| FPF is a first principle based architecture decisions for transdiciplinary SoTA methods of evolving holons: systems, epistemes, communities. | full text | FPF serves the Engineer, Researcher, and Manager by providing a generative pattern language for constructing and evolving thought, designed as an "operating system for thought".                                                     |
| Creativity in Open-Ended Evolution and Assurance*                                                                                            | full text | FPF integrates assurance (audits, evidence) and creativity (generating novel ideas) as complementary engines for responsible innovation, providing a structured choreography for creative work from abduction to operation.           |
| Navigating Uncertainty: Building Closed Worlds within an Open World                                                                          | full text | Explains how FPF reconciles Open-World and Closed-World assumptions, using Bounded Contexts to create reliable 'islands of closure' for engineering decisions within an inherently open world.                                        |
| FPF as an Evolutionary Architecture for Thought                                                                                              | full text | Positions FPF as an architecture for the reasoning process itself, designed to sustain key characteristics like auditability, evolvability, and falsifiability by applying architectural thinking to the dynamics of reasoning.       |
| Architectural Characteristic of Thought                                                                                                      | full text | Details the key characteristics of rigorous thought (e.g., Auditability, Evolvability, Composability) and the specific FPF mechanisms designed to preserve them.                                                                      |

| Thinking Through Writing: The FPF Discipline of Conceptual Work                                                                              | full text | Describes how FPF uses a discipline of "thinking through writing" with conceptual forms (Cards, Tables, Records) to make thought tangible, shareable, and auditable, while remaining tool-agnostic.                                   |
| Descriptive Ontologies vs. A Thinking-Oriented Architecture                                                                                  | full text | Differentiates FPF's goal of orchestrating reasoning from classical ontologies' goal of cataloging existence, emphasizing FPF's focus on objectives, trust, and dynamics.                                                             |

| From Flat Documents to High-Dimensional Truth: The Multi-View Architecture                                                                   | full text | Shows how FPF replaces flat documents with a multi-view architecture: epistemes as slot graphs, engineering views as projections, and MVPK as typed publication surfaces that keep dashboards lawfully tethered to work and evidence. |
| The “big storylines” unique to FPF (load‑bearing commitments)                                                                                | full text | Lists the nine core, load-bearing commitments that define FPF's unique architectural and philosophical stance, from its holonic kernel to its explicit treatment of creativity and assurance.                                         |
| Transdisciplinarity as a Meta‑Theory of Thinking                                                                                             | full text | Explains how FPF treats transdisciplinarity as a meta-theory for designing reasoning, using architheories as generative scaffolds grounded in physical reality to bridge disciplinary silos.                                          |
| FPF as a Culinary Architecture for Collective Thought: Why We Formalize “Obvious” Ideas                                                      | full text | Uses the 'culinary architecture' analogy to explain FPF's role in synthesizing 'obvious' ideas into a robust framework for complex, generative problems.                                                                              |
