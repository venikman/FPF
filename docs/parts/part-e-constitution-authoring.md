### Section E‑I · The FPF Constitution

#### Pattern E.1 — Vision & Mission: “Operating System for Thought”  \[A]

##### Problem frame
Modern engineering, science, and strategy all suffer from **conceptual overload**: dozens of domain tools, drifting vocabularies, and disconnected “best practices” splinter ideas as they travel from napkin sketch to certified deliverable. Stakeholders—*Engineers, Researchers, Learners*—lack a single, evolvable scaffold that can carry an insight across that span.

##### Problem
Absent such a scaffold, every discipline re‑invents epistemology and systems thinking, spawning silos, steep learning curves, and brittle life‑cycle models. Previous attempts either froze agility in rigid hierarchies or dissolved rigour in tool‑centric jargon.

##### Forces

| Force                           | Tension                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conceptual Unity**            | Freedom to evolve ↔ invariant principles that prevent vocabulary drift. |
| **Rigor vs Agility**            | Formal verifiability ↔ rapid, iterative exploration.                    |
| **Universality vs Specificity** | Domain‑agnostic kernel ↔ problem‑specific leverage.                     |
| **Didactic Clarity**            | Human comprehension ↔ abstract purity and density.                      |
| **Physical Grounding**          | Abstract constructs ↔ a *material Transformer* that proves feasibility.     |

**Mission Statement**

> *Enable any motivated system/actor/agent/transformer — human or AI — to transform a raw idea into a reproducible, auditable change in the physical world through incremental, falsifiable cycles.*

**Vision Statement**

> *Reliable reasoning should be as accessible as version control: clone the conceptual kernel, extend it with domain plugins, and commit decisions that remain traceable across time, scale, and discipline.*

##### Solution — *FPF as an Operating System for Thought*
FPF delivers a **generative scaffold** realised as:

1. a **micro‑kernel** of non‑derivable, cross‑domain **first principles**;
2. pluggable **architheories**—Systemic Calculus, Knowledge Dynamics, etc.—that instantiate those principles;
3. a **pattern language** (*Architectural* ► why/ how; *Definitional* ► what) with embedded **Conformance Checklist (CC)**;
4. **Design Rationale Records (DRRs)** that govern safe, auditable evolution;
5. three **core invariants** that every artefact must honour

   * **Evolvability** — change is expected and governed;
   * **Cross‑Scale Coherence** — the same algebra binds parts to wholes at any level;
   * **Didactic Transparency** — each element exposes its own reasoning path.

** Conformance Checklist**

| ID              | Requirement                                                                                                                                          | Rationale                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑Vision.1** | Every composite artefact **MUST** cite a *material Transformer* that can, in principle, perform the aggregation (`Γ(D,C)`) that produced it.             | Ensures physical feasibility and auditability.  |
| **CC‑Vision.2** | Every normative rule **MUST** demonstrably support at least one core invariant (*Evolvability, Cross‑Scale Coherence, Didactic Transparency*).       | Keeps the Canon lean and purpose‑driven.        |
| **CC‑Vision.3** | Conceptual text **MUST NOT** contain tokens black‑listed by the **DevOps Lexical Firewall** (`yaml`, `docker`, …).                                   | Preserves layer purity and tool‑agnostic core.  |
| **CC‑Vision.4** | A conformant artefact **MUST** state a measurable benefit for at least one of the three roles (*Engineer, Researcher, Learner*) or justify omission. | Aligns success with stakeholder trajectories.   |

##### Consequences

*Positive* — Unified language accelerates cross‑disciplinary discovery; regulators can audit claim lineages; learners acquire concepts through the spec itself.
*Trade‑offs* — Authors face an initial learning curve and must trace every rule to an invariant; disciplined traceability is required to prevent variant sprawl.

##### Relations & Precedence
Pattern E.1 governs **E.2 Eleven Pillars** and the Guard‑Rail set **A.5–A.8**; any later pattern that conflicts with E.1 **MUST** be revised via a DRR before entering the Canon.

*“Purpose without a scaffold is wishful thinking; a scaffold without purpose is cargo‑cult—FPF welds the two into disciplined imagination.”*

## E.2 — The Eleven Pillars \[A] 

### Problem frame 
Pattern E.1 set the FPF mission as an **operating system for thought**. To turn that mission into a durable architecture, FPF needs a small, explicit constitution—principles that remain stable while everything built on top of them can evolve. Without such invariants, domain silos, vocabulary drift, and tool‑centric shortcuts quickly erode coherence and reproducibility across disciplines.

### Problem
Frameworks without binding first principles wobble between two extremes: rigid dogmas that kill adaptation and amorphous guidelines that invite cognitive chaos. In either case, reasoning fragments, auditability collapses, and physical impact suffers.

##### Forces
| Force                          | Tension                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Foundational Stability**     | Immutable core ↔ perpetual adaptation to new knowledge |
| **Cognitive Load**             | Minimal elegance ↔ comprehensive coverage              |
| **Rigor vs Accessibility**     | Formal soundness ↔ intuitive entry for non‑specialists |
| **Universality vs Modularity** | Domain‑agnostic scope ↔ plug‑in extensibility          |
| **Pragmatic Grounding**        | Abstract invariants ↔ measurable, falsifiable outcomes |

### Solution
FPF rests on **eleven non‑negotiable pillars**. Each pillar is a binding constraint that every artefact, pattern, and design‑rationale record (DRR) **must** honour. Together they form the load‑bearing structure that guarantees evolvability, cross‑scale coherence, and didactic clarity.

| ID       | Pillar                         | Essence                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P‑1**  | **Cognitive Elegance**         | Highlight decisive structure, eliminate ornamental formalism; separate data governance from thinking.                     |
| **P‑2**  | **Didactic Primacy**           | Human comprehension outranks theoretical or tooling purity.                                                               |
| **P‑3**  | **Scalable Formality**         | A single artefact can mature step‑by‑step from informal guess to formally assured state without forks or rewrites.        |
| **P‑4**  | **Open‑Ended Kernel**          | The micro‑kernel contains only meta‑concepts; all domain knowledge lives in external architheories.                       |
| **P‑5**  | **Plug‑in Layering**           | Architheories are modular, declarative extensions that can be added, replaced, or removed without destabilising the core. |
| **P‑6**  | **Lexical Stratification**     | Every core concept is expressible in four registers: plain name, technical term, formal U.Type, and mathematical symbol.  |
| **P‑7**  | **Pragmatic Utility**          | Proofs, metrics, and models exist to achieve real‑world objectives; falsification is rewarded over confirmation.          |
| **P‑8**  | **Cross‑Scale Consistency**    | Composition algebras (aggregation, boundary, emergence) are invariant across material systems, knowledge, and methods.    |
| **P‑9**  | **State Explicitness**         | Every artefact declares its state (`design‑time`, `run‑time`, etc.); transitions are cheap, traceable, auditable.         |
| **P‑10** | **Open‑Ended Evolution**       | Every entity is expected to evolve indefinitely; cycles must remain cheap, safe, and cognitively rewarding.               |
| **P‑11** | **State‑of‑the‑Art Alignment** | The kernel and architheories track reliable contemporary knowledge and update when the SoTA advances.                     |

> Any DRR that contradicts a pillar must first amend this constitutional pattern.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑P‑1** | Every architectural pattern **must** list which pillar(s) it instantiates or refines.                                             | Guarantees constitutional grounding.  |
| **CC‑P‑2** | Every DRR proposing a normative change **must** include a “Pillar Impact Analysis.”                                               | Makes constitutional review explicit. |
| **CC‑P‑3** | Tooling and pedagogical artefacts **should** document which pillar(s) shape their design.                                         | Upholds P‑2 (Didactic Primacy).       |
| **CC‑P‑4** | An architheory is conformant only if its invariants reference **≥ 3** pillars, demonstrating cross‑scale and pragmatic alignment. | Prevents narrow, siloed extensions.   |
| **CC‑P‑5** | When two lawful approaches exist, authors **SHOULD** prefer methods whose **empirical capability slope** is **non‑negative** over the **audited scale window** (data, compute, **freedom‑of‑action**) and **MUST** justify any exception **via** a **BLP Scale‑Audit** (**BLP‑1**) with **declared tolerances** *(α = budget; δ = assurance; units specified)*. | Embeds Bitter‑Lesson preference; curbs heuristic debt. |
 
### Policy — Bitter‑Lesson Preference (BLP)

**Intent.** Favor **general, computation‑leveraged**, and **freedom‑of‑action** methods over hand‑tuned, brittle heuristics *when safety and legality are held constant*. This codifies the empirical trend that methods which scale with **data, compute, and search breadth** outpace bespoke rule‑engineering. **Applicability:** beyond ML, this policy covers **search/optimization**, **control**, **simulation‑based inference**, and other computational sciences where capability improves with scale and exploration. When **NQD/E/E‑LOG** promotes **novelty/coverage (illumination)** to **dominance**, these gauges are included in BLP comparisons for the audited window.

**BLP‑1 — Scale‑Audit Requirement.** Any DRR that selects a more specialized/hand‑engineered method over a general/scalable alternative **MUST** include a **Scale‑Audit**:
* (a) **Parity harness**: same **ComparatorSet**, **freshness window**, and **evaluation seeds/replicates**; portfolio‑first evaluation (see **G.5/G.9**). Dominance criterion: **Pareto‑only** by default across the declared objective vector; any alternative requires a documented waiver by **Gov‑CAL** under **E.3** precedence.
* (b) **Budgets**: sweep **compute** (**steps/tokens/params/time/energy**, as applicable), **data** (size/quality), and **freedom‑of‑action** (from script‑like instructions → minimal prohibitions) **under a fixed risk/safety envelope**. If any parameter cannot be swept, **pin** it and record the invariant.
* (c) **Slopes & uncertainty**: report ∂quality/∂compute, ∂quality/∂data, and (where applicable) ∂coverage/∂**freedom‑of‑action** and **∂novelty/∂budget**; include **error bars/CI** from multi‑seed trials; publish edition pins and policy‑IDs in SCR/telemetry (**G.11**).
* (d) **Resources**: publish **Resrc‑CAL** accounts (time/energy/FLOPs) and assurance deltas (B.3).  
* (e) **Objective declaration**: list the **objective vector** (quality, risk, cost, **and any illumination gauges** per NQD/E/E‑LOG) used for Pareto comparison.

**BLP‑2 — Preference Rule.** Given lawfulness and comparable assurance (within δ) and budget (within α), prefer the method whose **slope vector** is **Pareto‑dominant** over the audited range (per **BLP‑1c/1e**). If no dominance holds within error bounds, prefer the **more general** method (fewer domain‑specific heuristics, greater transfer via Bridges Φ/Ψ); otherwise resolve via **E/E‑LOG** tie‑breakers declared in policy.

**BLP‑3 — Minimal‑Prescription Default.** Author **rules‑as‑prohibitions** (negative constraints) over step‑by‑step scripts. Encode limits in **Φ policy tables** (and **Φ_plane** where applicable) instead of procedural checklists; allow the agent/system to sequence functions autonomously under those constraints (SoS‑LOG). **Pre/post‑conditions and test harnesses remain permitted**; **scripts** are permissible only when mandated by safety/regulation, or with compelling evidence recorded in the DRR **and reviewed under E.3 precedence / E.5 Guard‑Rails**.

**BLP‑4 — Heuristic‑Debt Register.** Any hand‑tuned rule admitted for pragmatic reasons **MUST** be registered as **Heuristic Debt** with: scope, owner, expiry/review window, measurable replacement target under BLP‑2, and a de‑hardening/sunset plan. Track in **CalibrationLedger/BCT (Baseline Change Tracker)** and cite in SCR.

**BLP‑5 — Continuous‑Learning Posture.** Where product policy allows, enable **feedback‑driven adaptation** (e.g., preference learning, critique loops) within Guard‑Rails (**E.5**) and privacy/regulatory controls, with appropriate opt‑outs where required. Disabling adaptation requires DRR justification and a review date.

**BLP‑6 — Precedence & Safeguards.** BLP is a **Gov/Arch** policy instantiated by Pillars **P‑10 (Open‑Ended Evolution)**, **P‑11 (SoTA Alignment)**, **P‑7 (Pragmatic Utility)**, and **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)**. It does **not** override safety/ethics (**E.5**) **nor** E.3 precedence rulings; where BLP conflicts with Guard‑Rails, **Guard‑Rails prevail**. When **NQD/E/E‑LOG** elevates illumination to dominance for exploration mandates, BLP **adopts that lens** rather than overriding it.

*Informative SoTA contexts (post‑2015):* portfolio‑first selection across **LLM prompt‑programming vs fine‑tuned task models**; **preference‑learning families (RLHF ↔ DPO)**; **QD archives (MAP‑Elites/CMA‑ME/DQD/QDax)**; **open‑ended environment–method co‑evolution (POET‑class)**; **offline RL vs Decision Transformer parity**; and beyond ML, **optimization/control** (model‑based planning vs hand‑tuned controllers) and **simulation‑based inference** in the sciences. These are **illustrative only**; use the parity harness instead of single‑winner leaderboards.

#### Conformance Checklist — BLP

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                                     | Purpose                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑BLP.1**  | Tolerances **α (budget)** and **δ (assurance)** are declared in the DRR or referenced via policy profile.      | Makes BLP decisions reproducible.             |
| **CC‑BLP.2**  | DRR includes a **Scale‑Audit** (BLP‑1a–e) with published slopes and pinned editions/policy‑IDs.               | Makes scale behavior auditable.               |
| **CC‑BLP.3**  | Selection decision cites **BLP‑2** and lists the governing pillars and precedence checks.                      | Ties choice to constitution.                  |
| **CC‑BLP.4**  | Any admitted heuristic is logged as **Heuristic Debt** with expiry/review and de‑hardening plan.               | Prevents silent drift toward brittle rules.   |
| **CC‑BLP.5**  | Default authoring uses **rules‑as‑prohibitions**; deviations are DRR‑justified and safety‑anchored.            | Preserves agent autonomy under constraints.   |
| **CC‑BLP.6**  | Resource accounts (time/energy/FLOPs) and assurance deltas are reported via **Resrc‑CAL** and B.3.             | Avoids “free heuristic” illusions.            |
| **CC‑BLP.7**  | **Replicate counts/seeds** and **confidence intervals** for slope estimates are recorded.                      | Prevents spurious slope inferences.           |

#### Relations
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑10, P‑11, P‑7, P‑1.  
* **Depends on:** **G.5/G.9** (admission/comparator/selector & parity harness), **G.11** (refresh telemetry), **C.5** (Resrc‑CAL), **C.18** (NQD‑CAL), **C.19** (E/E‑LOG), **F.7/F.9** (Bridges, CL/Φ/Ψ).  
* **Constrained by:** **E.5** Guard‑Rails (DevOps Lexical Firewall; Notational Independence; Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit) and **E.3** precedence.

#### Definitions
**α (budget tolerance)** may be relative or absolute; declare units (e.g., % cost, wall‑time, energy). **δ (assurance tolerance)** is the permissible delta in assurance under **B.3**; declare measure and floor(s).

#### Consequences

*Positive*

* Provides an explicit “north star” for every contributor.
* Delivers a falsifiable checklist for evaluating proposals.
* Builds trust in high‑assurance domains through transparency.

*Trade‑offs*

* Constitutional review adds friction to rapid, informal changes.
* Amending the pillar set itself demands high‑bar governance.

### Rationale

The pillars are distilled from systems engineering, philosophy of science, software architecture, and ontology design. They interlock: *Cognitive Elegance* (P‑1) enables *Didactic Primacy* (P‑2); *Open‑Ended Kernel* (P‑4) and *Plug‑in Layering* (P‑5) make *Open‑Ended Evolution* (P‑10) and *SoTA alignment* (P‑11) feasible; *Cross‑Scale Consistency* (P‑8) provides the algebraic backbone for *Scalable Formality* (P‑3). This minimal yet sufficient set balances stability with change, rigor with accessibility, and abstraction with measurable impact.

### Relations
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitutional/vision` – pillars operationalise the mission.
* **Refined by:** All subsequent patterns in the Core Specification.
* **Governs:** Every DRR, tool, and pedagogical artefact linked to FPF.

*These pillars are not a cage but the load‑bearing columns of a workshop where ideas can be safely built, dismantled, and evolved.*


## Pattern E.3 — **Principle Taxonomy & Precedence Model** \[A] 

### Problem frame
Pattern E.2 supplies eleven immutable pillars, yet experience shows that a **flat list of principles invites ambiguity**: reviewers cannot decide which pillar overrules another  and “dead‑letter” rules accumulate. 

### Problem

When two pillars or derived principles pull in opposite directions, architectural decisions stall—or worse, drift toward the loudest voice. Without an explicit **taxonomy and precedence cascade**, FPF risks devolving into subjective debate, breaking its claim to be a rigorously *auditable* “operating system for thought.”

### Forces
| Force                                 | Tension                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Categorical Clarity**               | Coherent grouping ↔ preservation of individual nuance              |
| **Deterministic Conflict Resolution** | Predictable hierarchy ↔ flexibility for context‑specific overrides |
| **Evolutionary Stability**            | Durable core ↔ adaptability to new knowledge                       |

### Solution
1. **Principle Taxonomy**
   Every principle is an instance of `U.Principle` assigned **exactly one** class ∈ { `Gov`, `Arch`, `Epist`, `Prag`, `Did` }.

   | Class                                    | Scope & Purpose                           | Example Pillars                                   |   |
   | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | - |
   | **Gov** (Governance)                     | Change process, community decision‑making | P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution · P‑11 SoTA             |   |
   | **Arch** (Architectural)                 | Macro‑structure & invariants              | P‑1 Cognitive Elegance · P‑4 Kernel               |   |
   | **Epist** (Epistemological and Ontological) | Semantics, evidence, trust                | P‑3 Scalable Formality · P‑8 Consistency          |   |
   | **Prag** (Pragmatic)                     | Real‑world value & cost/benefit           | P‑7 Pragmatic Utility                             |   |
   | **Did** (Didactic)                       | Cognition & learnability                  | P‑2 Didactic Primacy · P‑6 Lexical Stratification |   |

   *Epistemological* sub‑concerns (reasoning, falsifiability) reside inside **Onto**, avoiding category sprawl yet keeping semantics and trust in one bucket.

 2. **Precedence Stack**

   | Level | Governing Artefact                    | Overrides        |
   | ----- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
   | 0     | **Vision & Mission** (E.1)            | everything       |
   | 1     | **Eleven Pillars** (E.2)              | all below        |
   | 2     | **Principles** (this pattern)         | patterns & DRRs  |
   | 3     | Architectural / Definitional patterns | local rules      |
   | 4     | Tooling & Pedagogy                    | informative only |

**Within Level 2 of precedence stack** the default order is:
`Gov ≫ Arch ≫ Epist ≫ Prag ≫ Did`

 **Graph Rule** — The precedence graph MUST be acyclic; any new edge that would form a cycle is **rejected**.
 
Governance principle vs Architectural principle clash: e.g. Core release schedule (Gov) outranks performance‑tuning (Prag)

### Conformance Checklist

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                          | Purpose                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **CC‑PT.1** | Every principle record **MUST** state `class` and may list `precedence_over[]`.                                      | Enables deterministic overrides. |
| **CC‑PT.2** | Precedence graph **MUST** be acyclic.    | Prevents circular law.           |
| **CC‑PT.3** | Any DRR introducing/modifying a principle **MUST** include a *Pillar Impact Analysis* and proposed precedence edges impact on each affected Pillar (P‑1… P‑11)| Aligns evolution with Pillars.   |

### Illustrative Conflict Resolution

1. **The Conflict**  
   * **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** (`Arch`) demands an unambiguous term for “part–whole” entities, pushing us toward **Holon**.  
   * **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** (`Did`) values immediate practitioner familiarity, pushing us to retain **System**.

2. **Risk of Stalemate**  
   Without a precedence cascade, the discussion would collapse into subjective argument: *“purity beats clarity!”* vs *“clarity beats purity!”*.

3. **Applying the Precedence Model**  
   * Default order: **Gov ≫ Arch ≫ Epist ≫ Prag ≫ Did**.  
   * `Arch` outranks `Did`; therefore **P‑1** takes formal precedence over **P‑2**.

4. **Principled Decision**  
   We adopted **Holon** to satisfy the higher‑priority principle and mitigated the didactic cost by:  
   * declaring `System ≡ U.System ⊑ U.Holon`,  
   * providing aliases and an “On‑Ramp” tutorial.

> *The precedence rule did not merely name a winner; it compelled a solution that honoured both principles in proportion to their rank.*

**Precedence (high → low).** Law & Regulation → **E.5 Guard‑Rails** → **B.3 Trust & Assurance** → **E.3 governance decisions** → **E/E‑LOG policies** (editioned) → **BLP (E.2)** → Product Policies → Implementation Tactics.

**Notes.**
* BLP is a constitutional policy (see E.2 / “BLP”), but **does not supersede** E.5 Guard‑Rails nor B.3 assurance floors; it **does govern** ties among lawful, comparable‑assurance options.
* Wherever **NQD/E/E‑LOG** promotes illumination gauges to dominance, **BLP adopts that lens** rather than overriding it (see E.2 BLP‑6).
* Any exception to policy **MUST** include a DRR with rationale and expiry.
* **BLP Override (Waiver).** When a narrower hand‑engineered method is selected over a general/scalable alternative **within declared tolerances** (α = budget, δ = assurance), the DRR **MUST** include:
  - a **BLP Scale‑Audit** (see E.2 **BLP‑1**) covering compute/data/**freedom‑of‑action** sweeps and slope/uncertainty reporting,
  - the **tolerances** α/δ and objective vector used (E.2 **BLP‑1e**),
  - a **Heuristic‑Debt** entry (owner, scope, expiry/review, de‑hardening plan) per E.2 **BLP‑4**,
  - an **Oversight Level** (see **E.3‑ABL**) and the approving authority (see **Approval matrix** below).
**Portfolio‑first parity.** All precedence decisions that compare methods **MUST** use the G.5/G.9 parity harness and **Pareto** dominance; scalarisation across mixed scales/units is **prohibited** (B.3).

**BLP — Bitter‑Lesson Hooks into Precedence**
1) **Tie‑breaking.** If two lawful options are **within δ** assurance and **within α** budget, prefer the option whose **slope vector Pareto‑dominates** over the audited window; if no dominance, prefer the **more general** method. (E.2 **BLP‑2**.)
2) **Script‑vs‑Search conflicts.** For conflicts between **procedural scripts** and **general search/learning**, scripts prevail **only** when mandated by E.5 or regulation, or when a DRR records a **BLP‑waiver** with expiry and hazard rationale (E.2 **BLP‑3/6**).
3) **Publication.** Precedence rulings that reference BLP **MUST** publish editioned policy‑IDs, edition pins, and **Resrc‑CAL** accounts to the SCR (E.2 **BLP‑1d**; G.11).

**ABL — Autonomy‑Budget & Oversight Levels**
This section defines **graduated levels of agent autonomy** (level taxonomy), the **budget envelopes** they operate under, and the **review/approval** gates. Levels apply to any **Agentic Tool‑Use & Call‑Planning** context (see **C.Agent‑Tools‑CAL**).

| Level | Name                         | Freedom‑of‑Action (FoA)                  | Explore‑Share (default) | Typical Use                                     | Oversight Gate |
|------:|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **L0** | Scripted Execution           | **Whitelist only**; fixed scripts        | 0                       | Compliance‑critical, deterministic procedures   | Engineer‑of‑Record (EoR) |
| **L1** | Constrained Sequencing       | Negative constraints; **single‑tool**    | ≤ 0.10                  | Low‑risk automation with bounded novelty        | EoR + Peer Review |
| **L2** | Supervised Autonomy          | Multi‑tool plans; bounded replanning     | 0.20 (±0.10)            | Ambiguous tasks; moderate budget                | Team Lead + Safety |
| **L3** | Auditable Autonomy           | Multi‑step, self‑replanning; adaptive    | 0.30 (±0.10)            | Production agents with learning under guard‑rails | Product + Safety + Legal |
| **L4** | Open‑Ended / Research Mode   | Broad FoA within sandbox & rails         | 0.40–0.50               | Illumination‑first exploration, sandboxes only  | Governance Board (Gov‑CAL) |

**Normative requirements by level.**
* **Budgets.** Each level **MUST** declare ceilings for **time / compute / cost / risk** and a FoA descriptor; units must be explicit (Resrc‑CAL). Budgets are **hard gates** at run‑time (C.Agent‑Tools‑CAL **ATC‑3**).
* **Assurance floors.** **B.3** WLNK minima on **F** and **R** apply at all levels; **CL penalties** for integration **increase** with level (B.3.3). Pre‑deployment **assurance deltas** MUST be recorded for L2+.
* **Exploration discipline.** `explore_share` MUST be explicit in the **CallPlan** (C.Agent‑Tools‑CAL **ATC‑4**). Deviations from defaults require DRR justification.
* **Provenance.** L1+ MUST emit a **CallGraph** with Service/Method editions, EmitterPolicyRef, budget deltas, and observation hooks (C.Agent‑Tools‑CAL **ATC‑5/6**).
* **BLP conformance.** For L2+, selection MUST apply **BLP** (E.2 **BLP‑2**) with **α/δ** tolerances declared in the plan policy. Any admitted heuristic requires a **Heuristic‑Debt** entry (E.2 **BLP‑4**).
* **Learning/Adaptation.** L3–L4 MAY enable **feedback‑driven adaptation** within E.5 Guard‑Rails and privacy controls; L0–L2 default **off** unless a DRR documents mitigation (E.2 **BLP‑5**).
* **Human‑in‑the‑Loop (HITL).** L0–L1 require **pre‑approval** of plans; L2 requires **sentinel‑triggered pausing** for review; L3 requires **periodic** review windows; L4 requires **continuous** telemetry review and **sandboxing**.

**Approval matrix (who can approve what).**
* **L0:** EoR or appointed maintainer.
* **L1:** EoR **and** peer reviewer (two‑person rule).
* **L2:** Team Lead **and** Safety representative.
* **L3:** Product Owner **and** Safety **and** Legal/Privacy.
* **L4:** **Gov‑CAL Board** (multi‑disciplinary) with documented scope, time‑boxed **trial budget**, and rollback criteria.

**Escalation / de‑escalation triggers.**
* **Escalate** level when repeated **BLP‑consistent** results show stable assurance within δ and budget adherence within α for ≥ **N_policy** runs (declare **N_policy** in the active profile); DRR **MUST** include slope evidence (E.2 **BLP‑1c**).
* **De‑escalate** level when: (i) sentinel breaches risk or budget, (ii) assurance drops below floors, (iii) policy changes, or (iv) a significant **heuristic‑debt** item expires without replacement.

##### Consequences
*Positive* — Turns subjective debate into objective, traceable decisions; high‑impact conflicts surface early.

##### Rationale
The chosen taxonomy mirrors FPF’s layered dependency: **Governance** rules how change occurs; **Architecture** shapes what can exist; **Epistemology** secures meaning and trust; **Pragmatics** and **Didactics** ensure usefulness and learnability. Explicit override edges supply the flexibility experts need, while the default hierarchy keeps day‑to‑day design deterministic—a “living constitution” that remains both human‑intelligible and machine‑enforceable.

##### Relations
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitutional/vision`, `pat:constitutional/pillars`
* **Governs:** All subsequent patterns and DRRs; Guard‑Rail patterns reference CC‑PT.\

> *“A taxonomy sorts principles; precedence gives them order—together they convert debate into design.”*

### **E.4 — FPF Artefact Architecture \[A]**

##### Problem frame

The FPF ecosystem produces a wide range of artifacts, from timeless, normative principles to rapidly evolving pedagogical materials and executable tools. If these different types of artifacts are mingled without a clear architectural separation, the ecosystem becomes difficult to navigate, govern, and maintain. Users cannot easily distinguish binding rules from helpful advice, and the entire framework's release cycle becomes coupled to its most volatile component.

##### Problem

How can we structure the FPF ecosystem to ensure a clean separation of concerns between normative concepts, didactic materials, and executable tooling? A formal architecture is required to maintain conceptual purity, enable independent evolution of components, and provide a clear map for all stakeholders.

##### Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stability vs. Agility** | The conceptual core must evolve slowly and deliberately ↔ tools and tutorials must iterate quickly to keep pace with technology and user needs. |
| **Authority vs. Accessibility** | Users need to know which rules are normative and binding ↔ they also need accessible, non-normative guides to help them learn. |
| **Modularity vs. Cohesion** | The different artifact families must be able to evolve independently ↔ they must remain part of a single, coherent FPF ecosystem. |

##### Solution

The FPF ecosystem is formally stratified into three canonical **artefact families**. Each family has a distinct purpose and is governed by different rules, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The interaction between these families is governed by the **Unidirectional Dependency Principle** (see Guard-Rail E.5.3).

1.  **The Conceptual Core (The Canon):** This family contains the **normative** pattern language of FPF. It is the single source of truth for all universal concepts, rules, and invariants. It is defined to be tool-agnostic and notation-independent. This family represents the timeless "law" of FPF.

2.  **The Tooling Reference:** This family contains **executable artifacts** that implement or verify the normative rules of the Core. This includes reference linters, simulators, and data schemas. This family is the "instrument" that makes the law of the Core operational.

3.  **The Pedagogical Companion:** This family contains **non-normative, didactic materials** designed to help humans learn and apply FPF. This includes tutorials, worked examples, and playbooks. This family is the "textbook" that explains both the law and the instruments.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

*   **For a `U.System`:**
    *   **Conceptual Core:** Defines the universal pattern `U.System`.
    *   **Tooling Reference:** Provides a modeling language profile or a serialization schema for modeling systems.
    *   **Pedagogical Companion:** Provides a tutorial on how to model a water pump using that profile.

*   **For an `U.Episteme`:**
    *   **Conceptual Core:** Defines `U.Episteme` and the F-G-R characteristics.
    *   **Tooling Reference:** Provides the reference linting tool to automatically score epistemes.
    *   **Pedagogical Companion:** Provides a case study on how a scientific theory's R-score evolves over time.

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CC-E.4.1** | Every artifact in the FPF ecosystem **MUST** declare which of the three families (Core, Tooling, Pedagogy) it belongs to. |
| **CC-E.4.2** | The content of each artifact **MUST** be consistent with the defined purpose of its family (e.g., no normative rules in the Pedagogical Companion). |
| **CC‑E.4.3** | Artefacts in the Tooling or Pedagogy families SHALL NOT be imported by artefacts in the Conceptual Core. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Users and contributors can immediately identify the nature and authority of any given artifact. | **Requires Discipline:** Authors must be careful to place new content in the correct artifact family. |
| **Decoupled Release Cycles:** The Core can maintain a stable, slow release cadence, while the Tooling and Pedagogy artifact family can evolve rapidly. | - |
| **Architectural Clarity:** Provides a simple, powerful mental model for navigating the entire FPF ecosystem. | - |

##### Rationale

This pattern establishes the macro-architecture of the entire FPF ecosystem. By separating the timeless "why" and "what" (the Conceptual Core) from the practical "how" (Tooling) and the educational "how-to-learn" (Pedagogy), it creates a system that is simultaneously stable, agile, and accessible. This layered architecture is a proven pattern in large-scale systems, from the OSI model in networking to the structure of modern operating systems, and it is essential for FPF's long-term health and scalability.

##### Relations

*   **Instantiates:** **P-5 (Plugin Layering)** at a macro-level.
*   **Is Constrained by:** **E.5.3 (Unidirectional Dependency)**.
*   **Is Foundation For:** The entire authoring and governance model, as it defines the "territories" where different rules apply.

> *“A canon without a rationale is scripture; a rationale without a canon is gossip. FPF keeps both, fused in patterns.”*

###  E.5 · Four Guard‑Rails of FPF         \[A]

#### Problem frame  
FPF positions itself as a **timeless, universal “operating system for
thought.”**  Collaborative projects of this scope face four predictable
entropic pulls:

1. **Implementation gravity** – concept prose accretes tool jargon.  
2. **Notation lock‑in** – one diagram style becomes “the language.”  
3. **Convenience cycles** – quick fixes create reverse dependencies.  
4. **Disciplinary monoculture** – implicit bias colours “universal” rules.

Left unchecked, these forces erode Pillars **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**,
**P‑4 Open‑Ended Kernel** and **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering**.

#### Problem  
Without explicit, non‑negotiable protectors the Conceptual Core would
slowly:

* entangle with transient technology terms,  
* hard‑freeze into a single dialect,  
* devolve into a tightly coupled “big ball of mud”,  
* betray its trans‑disciplinary promise.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Purity vs Pragmatism** | Preserve pristine concepts ↔ need real examples. |
| **Universality vs Convention** | Rules valid across domains ↔ convenience of one familiar notation. |
| **Modularity vs Integration** | Independent layers ↔ temptation to cross‑link for speed. |
| **Objectivity vs Perspective** | Neutral framework ↔ Transformers’ unavoidable cultural lens. |

#### Solution — the Four Guard‑Rails  
FPF establishes **four architecturally enforced guard‑rails** that every Core, Tooling, and Pedagogy artefact must obey.  They function as an “immune system” resisting each entropic pull.
**Scope note (conceptual, not lint).** These guard‑rails regulate the **architecture of thought**—concepts, claims, and their relations. They **do not** mandate tools, file formats, notations, or workflows; any linting or automation lives outside the Core and is optional, provided it preserves these conceptual constraints.


| # | Guard‑Rail | Protects against |
|---|------------|------------------|
| **GR‑1** | **DevOps Lexical Firewall** | Implementation, governance, automatisation and DevOps concerns gravity |
| **GR‑2** | **Notational Independence** | Notation lock‑in |
| **GR‑3** | **Unidirectional Dependency** | Convenience cycles |
| **GR‑4** | **Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit** | Disciplinary monoculture |

Concrete rules for each rail live in patterns **E.5.1 – E.5.4**.

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Guard‑Rail | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| GR‑1 | Definition of `U.System` never cites file formats or build scripts. | Definition of `U.Episteme` avoids naming specific proof engines. |
| GR‑2 | Pump boundary invariant is true in plain text or any diagram. | F‑G‑R semantics hold in algebraic or graph notation alike. |
| GR‑3 | A sizing helper imports Core invariants; Core never imports helper tutorials. | Learning guide cites R‑score; Core never cites guide. |
| GR‑4 | Bias audit removes thermo‑mechanical jargon from a “universal” pattern. | Audit replaces physics‑centric metaphors in a trust pattern. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑GR.1** | Every new Core pattern **SHALL** cite, in its *Relations* section, the guard‑rail(s) it relies on or may affect. | Ensures traceability and deliberate rule interaction. |
| **CC‑GR.2** | Artefacts classified as Tooling or Pedagogy **MUST NOT** violate any rule in GR‑1 through GR‑4. | Keeps entropic forces outside the Conceptual Core. |
| **CC‑GR.3** | A revision to any guard‑rail pattern **REQUIRES** a Design‑Rationale Record that (a) states the reason, and (b) includes a Pillar‑impact analysis per E.3 precedence model. | Aligns evolution with higher‑level principles. |
| **CC‑GR.4** | The aggregate of guard‑rail rules **MUST** remain internally consistent and acyclic; no guard‑rail may override another without explicit precedence edges. | Preserves deterministic governance. |
| **CC‑GR.5** | Every Core pattern **MUST** anchor its primary subject with a declared **ReferencePlane** (`world | concept | episteme`) at first mention. | Keeps Core about “life” objects (extensional/intensional) rather than their paperwork, and aligns with CHR:ReferencePlane. |
*All CC‑GR duties are **conceptual**. Any automated checks are **informative only** and live in Tooling/Pedagogy.*

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Long‑term integrity** – stops slow drift of the Core toward jargon, notation lock‑in, and hidden cycles. | Authors must run a guard‑rail checklist before submission. *Mitigation:* template auto‑inserts the checklist. |
| **Stable yet evolvable ecosystem** – Core stays timeless while Tooling & Pedagogy can iterate rapidly. | Early stage contributions may feel constrained; examples in the Pedagogical Companion show compliant paths. |
| **Trust & auditability** – stakeholders can verify the framework’s purity independently. | Adds overhead to governance; justified by safety and longevity. |

#### Rationale  
A constitution without enforcement degrades into *dead‑letter rules*.  
The four guard‑rails translate abstract Pillars into **concrete, testable
constraints**.  Grouping them under one umbrella pattern:

* gives newcomers a single “safety index” to consult,  
* makes compliance binary (*pass / amend*),  
* provides a stable anchor for future automated conformance tools—without
  mentioning any specific engine, thus honouring GR‑1 itself.

They collectively instantiate Pillars **P‑1**, **P‑2**, **P‑4**, **P‑5**
and reinforce the precedence order defined in **E.3**.

#### Relations

* **Comprises:**  
  * `pat:guard/devops‑firewall` (E.5.1) – GR‑1  
  * `pat:guard/notational‑independence` (E.5.2) – GR‑2  
  * `pat:guard/unidirectional‑dependency` (E.5.3) – GR‑3  
  * `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E.5.4) – GR‑4
* **Depends on:**  
  * `pat:constitution/pillars` (E.2)  
  * `pat:constitution/principle‑taxonomy` (E.3)
* **Constrains:** every Core, Tooling, and Pedagogy artefact; all DRRs.

####  E.5.1 · DevOps Lexical Firewall \[D]

##### Problem frame  
The FPF Core is meant to remain valid across decades and technology
generations.  Implementation details—file formats, build pipelines,
runtime flags—evolve rapidly and differ between domains.  When such
terms invade normative prose, the Core ages as quickly as the tools it
mentions.

##### Problem  
*Conceptual erosion*: a rule that cites a transient technology becomes
obsolete when that technology fades, forcing unnecessary Core revisions
and fragmenting historical audits.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Timelessness** | Concepts must survive tool turnover. |
| **Pedagogic clarity** | Examples need concreteness ↔ too much concreteness hard‑codes technology. |
| **Cross‑domain reach** | Physical‑system engineers and knowledge‑theorists use different stacks. |

##### Solution  
Establish a **Lexical Firewall** around the **Conceptual Core** *(conceptual constraint; not a build‑time linter)*:

1. **Forbidden lexicon**  
   Normative patterns **SHALL NOT** contain tool‑or file‑specific words
   (e.g. protocol keywords, file extensions, IDE commands).  
   Permissible wording: “a reference parser”, “a serialisation schema”.

2. **Indirection rule**  
   When a Core concept needs an executable illustration, the pattern
   cites the **Tooling Reference family** artefact by *conceptual name*,
   never by concrete path or syntax.

3. **Glossary pointer**  
   If an unavoidable technical term appears, it is defined in a *Tooling Glossary* outside the Core and referenced by conceptual alias—not embedded.
*Non‑normative automation.* Machine checks **MAY** exist in Tooling; they are advisory and **MUST NOT** be imported into the Core.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Scenario | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Normative text** | “A system boundary must expose at least one conserved‑quantity flow.” (No mention of modelling language.) | “An episteme records its F–G–R coordinates.” (No mention of proof syntax.) |
| **Illustrative link** | A modelling profile resides in the Tooling family; Core cites it as “the reference system‑profile”. | A linting routine lives in Tooling; Core cites it as “the reference episteme‑checker”. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑LFW.1** | A Core pattern **SHALL** fail review if it contains implementation‑specific tokens. |
| **CC‑LFW.2** | References to executable artefacts **MUST** use conceptual names, not file paths or command strings. |
| **CC‑LFW.3** | Pedagogical examples inside Core **MAY** describe behaviour, but **MUST NOT** embed code snippets. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays evergreen and cross‑domain. | Authors must relocate concrete examples to Tooling or Pedagogy. |
| Reviewers can machine‑scan for banned tokens. | Requires a small vocabulary allow‑list; maintained in Tooling Guide. |

##### Rationale  
Language shapes thought.  By firewalling transient jargon, we uphold
**P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** (clarity), **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** (domain‑neutral
exposition) and **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering** (clean separation between Core
and Tooling).  The rule is content‑agnostic and thus itself immune to the
very decay it prevents.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Constrains:** every pattern in Conceptual Core  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2, P‑5
  
  ####  E.5.2 · Notational Independence \[D]

##### Problem frame  
FPF concepts must travel across academic disciplines, modelling tools,
and future notations we cannot yet foresee. If a normative pattern binds
its *meaning* to one diagram style, file syntax, or markup dialect, the
concept ages as soon as the notation does.

##### Problem  
*Semantic lock‑in*: when a definition relies on a particular glyph set or
diagram grammar, alternative communities either translate it—risking
drift—or ignore FPF altogether.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Expressiveness** | Diagrams and formal grammars aid precision ↔ they should never become the definition itself. |
| **Longevity** | A 20‑year horizon ↔ notation life‑cycles of 3‑5 years. |
| **Cross‑discipline adoption** | Mathematicians prefer algebraic syntax; engineers prefer schematics. |

##### Solution — Notational Independence Guard‑Rail *(conceptual; semantics over syntax; not a notation mandate)*

1. **Semantics primacy**  
   Normative content **SHALL** define concepts in linguistic form first
   (plain English + mathematics if needed). Visual or syntax examples
   are secondary illustrations.

2. **Equivalence clause**  
   When an official alternate notation exists, the pattern must state:
   *“Representation A and Representation B are semantically equivalent
   under mapping M.”*

3. **Reference indirection**  
   If the Core cites a diagram, it does so by *conceptual role*
   (“reference boundary schematic”) rather than by file or syntax name.

4. **Conceptual prefix neutrality**  
   FPF **conceptual prefixes** (e.g., `U.`, `Γ_`, `ut:`, `tv:`, `ev:`, `mero:`) are  **cognitive namespaces**, not syntax tokens. Core patterns **MUST NOT**  tie their meaning to any concrete serialisation or URI scheme for these prefixes; any expansions are **illustrative only** and live in Tooling or Pedagogy.

5. **Cards and other "forms"**
Cards, tables and other "forms" exist in FPF core only as conceptual model, not as data model, thus no need to data-related notation or notation for lint. Comformance checklist and quards is also conceptual, argumentation like "this will ease machine check" is forbidden, no machine checking is intended in core; machine checks and linters live only in Tooling.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Scenario | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Definition | Boundary of a pump is expressed in prose plus set notation; a diagram is illustrative. | F‑G‑R characteristics defined textually; a triple‑store serialisation is illustrative. |
| Alternate rendering | Same pump semantics rendered in a lattice diagram or a tabular sheet remain valid. | R‑scores plotted in a heatmap or listed in CSV remain equivalent. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑NI.1** | A Core pattern **MUST NOT** embed semantics that hinge on one specific notation. |
| **CC‑NI.2** | Illustrative renderings **SHALL** be marked “informative”. |
| **CC‑NI.3** | When multiple official renderings exist, the pattern **MUST** declare the semantic mapping between them. |
| **CC‑NI.4** | If a **conceptual prefix** appears in Core, its expansion (if shown) **SHALL** be marked *informative* and **MUST NOT** be required to interpret the semantics. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Ensures FPF survives notation turnover. | Authors invest time describing mappings; mitigated by reusable mapping templates. |
| Lowers entry barrier for domains using different diagram traditions. | Excessive illustrations can bloat pages; guidance in Pedagogical Companion limits scope. |

##### Rationale  
Language and diagrams are tools, not truths. By elevating semantics over
syntax, FPF maintains **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** and **P‑2 Didactic
Primacy** while safeguarding **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering**: tooling layers can
add new renderers without Core edits.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Constrains:** every normative Core pattern and official alternate rendering  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2, P‑5

####  E.5.3 · Unidirectional Dependency \[D]

##### Problem frame  
FPF separates artefacts into stable **Conceptual Core**, executable
**Tooling Reference**, and fast‑evolving **Pedagogical Companion** (see
E.4 Artefact Architecture).  If dependencies can point *both* ways,
volatile layers will eventually drag the Core into rapid revision
cycles or introduce domain‑specific bias.

##### Problem  
*Architectural gravity*: a tutorial or helper script adds a new feature,
Core patterns import it “temporarily,” and within months the supposedly
timeless layer depends on transient assets—breaking Pillar **P‑5
Plug‑in Layering**.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Stability** | Tooling must iterate quickly ↔ Core must remain slow and deliberate. |
| **Reuse vs Isolation** | Authors want to reuse helper concepts ↔ Core cannot depend on volatile code. |
| **Simplicity** | Rule must be testable and unambiguous ↔ must allow legitimate upward imports. |

##### Solution — One‑Way, Acyclic Imports  
Define a strict **partial order** over artefact families **and guard meaning flow** (see **E.10 V‑1**): imports point only **upward** in stability, and **no Core semantics** may derive from Tooling/Pedagogy. No linters or machine checking in Conceptual Core.

Pedagogical Companion  ⟶  Tooling Reference  ⟶  Conceptual Core

1. **Allowed edges**  
   Dependencies **MAY** point **only upward** (toward greater semantic
   stability). No cycle is ever permitted.

2. **No downward import**  
   Core artefacts **SHALL NOT** import Tooling or Pedagogy artefacts.
   Tooling artefacts **SHALL NOT** import Pedagogy artefacts.

3. **Future layers**  
   Any new family is inserted below an existing one or becomes part of
   the Tooling or Pedagogy strata; the ordering extends accordingly.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Layer | `U.System` illustration | `U.Episteme` illustration |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Core | Definition of `U.System` and boundary invariant. | Definition of F‑G‑R characteristics. |
| Tooling | “Reference system‑profile” that checks boundary flow; *imports* Core invariants. | “Episteme‑scoring routine” that calculates R‑score; *imports* Core characteristics. |
| Pedagogy | Tutorial using the system‑profile to model a pump; *imports* profile and Core term. | Case study explaining R‑score evolution; *imports* scoring routine and Core term. |
| **Forbidden** | Core pattern importing measurement script. | Core pattern importing R‑score web dashboard. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑UD.1** | Dependency graph among all artefacts **MUST** be acyclic. |
| **CC‑UD.2** | An artefact **SHALL** import only from its own family or any family above it in the order. |
| **CC‑UD.3** | A DRR that introduces a downward edge **SHALL** be automatically rejected. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays free of tool churn and tutorial bias. | Authors must create abstraction layers in Tooling instead of inserting hooks into Core. |
| Release cadence decoupled: Core (slow), Tooling (medium), Pedagogy (fast). | Slight duplication when multiple tools target same concept; mitigated by shared Core definitions. |

##### Rationale  
One‑way import graphs are a proven safeguard in operating systems
(kernel vs user land) and layered protocols. Here the rule operationalises
Pillars **P‑4 Open‑Ended Kernel** and **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering**, ensuring
that innovation happens “below” without contaminating the timeless Core.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **References layer definition:** `pat:constitution/artefact‑architecture` (E.4)  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑4, P‑5  
* **Constrains:** All artefact imports recorded in DRRs or SCRs

#### E.5.4 — Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit** \[D]

##### Problem frame  
FPF calls itself trans‑disciplinary, but every author carries implicit
metaphors from a home domain. If those metaphors leak into “universal”
patterns, practitioners from other fields disengage or mis‑interpret the
rules.

##### Problem  
Unrecognised bias hides in wording, examples, unit choices or principle
weighting. Once embedded in normative language, such bias is hard to
remove and contradicts Pillars **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** and **P‑8
Cross‑Scale Consistency**.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Neutrality** | One voice for all disciplines ↔ need for relatable examples. |
| **Conciseness** | Audit guidance must be brief ↔ must cover multiple bias types. |
| **Longevity** | Guidance must survive emergence of new domains. |

##### Solution — Principle‑Taxonomy‑Guided Bias Audit  

1. **Bias‑Lens set**  
   Every normative pattern is assessed through **five lenses** that match the
   Principle classes from **E.3**:  
   `Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`.

2. **Equilibrium question**  
   For each lens ask:  
   *“Does the pattern over‑privilege this class or silence it?”*  
   *Examples:*  
   *   Over‑reliance on `Onto/Epist` precision may ignore `Prag` cost.  
   *   Dominant `Arch` metaphors may alienate `Did` audiences.

3. **Scope‑or‑Balance rule**  
   * If imbalance is found and universality is intended, re‑phrase to
     restore balance.  
   * If imbalance is intentional (domain‑specific pattern), mark the
     scope explicitly: *“Applies primarily to thermodynamic systems.”*

4. **Audit trace**  
   The pattern carries a short **Bias‑Annotation** paragraph recording
   which lenses were tested and any scoping statement. No workflow checklists or
   reviewer metadata or other data and data format and data governance tips is stored in the Core.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Bias lens | Example imbalance | Conceptual correction |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| `Arch` vs `Did` | Pump pattern uses abstract category theory terms. | Add plain‑language boundary narrative or move abstraction to appendix. |
| `Onto/Epist` vs `Prag` | Episteme trust score defined with complex logic but no guidance on empirical cost. | Add pragmatic note on evidence collection burden or scope the pattern. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑BA.1** | Each Core pattern **SHALL** include a *Bias‑Annotation* listing the five lenses and any declared scope limitation. | Ensures explicit reflection on bias. |
| **CC‑BA.2** | A pattern labelled “universal” **MUST NOT** privilege a single lens without justification or scoping note. | Preserves trans‑disciplinary integrity. |
| **CC‑BA.3** | If scope is declared, the pattern **SHALL** reference the mapping or rationale that enables cross‑domain translation. | Keeps pathways open for other calculi. |
| **CC‑BA.4 (QD‑triad evidence for “universal”).** | Any pattern that labels itself **“universal”** SHALL cite **A.8 CC‑UC 1 + CC‑UC 2** and attach the **QD evidence** (Diversity_P + IlluminationSummary, with edition and binning) or else **scope** the claim to its home Context. | preserves domain quality diversity |

##### Consequences  

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Neutral, inclusive language attracts wider adoption. | Authors spend a few extra lines on Bias‑Annotation; mitigated by template snippet. |
| Bias is surfaced at writing time, not after publication. | — |

##### Rationale  
Coupling the audit directly to the Principle Taxonomy keeps the guard‑rail
**concept‑driven**, not workflow‑driven. No mention of review boards,
CI‑jobs, or checklists appears in the Core; such mechanics belong in the
Tooling Guide. This guard‑rail therefore satisfies **GR‑1** (Firewall)
while securing Pillars **P‑2, P‑7 Pragmatic Utility, P‑8**.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitution/principle‑taxonomy` (E.3)  
* **Constrains:** All normative patterns claiming universality
  
### E.6 · Didactic Architecture of the Specification \[D]

#### Problem frame  
FPF addresses readers from at least two characteristics of diversity:

* **Disciplinary** – systems engineers, knowledge scientists, ethicists.  
* **Experience** – newcomers need intuition; experts need rigour.

Past drafts mixed governance mandates with domain examples, producing a
steep learning curve and repeated “forward‑reference” detours.

#### Problem  
If core ideas are buried under formalism or scattered across parts,
readers either give up or misuse the framework. We need a **fixed
narrative scaffold** that guides cognitive load from low to high while
keeping normative sections discoverable.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Cognitive Load** | Early clarity ↔ eventual formal depth. |
| **Conceptual Integrity** | Foregoing examples risks abstraction ↔ too many examples delay axioms. |
| **Uniform Flow** | Single, predictable roadmap ↔ flexibility for future parts. |

#### Solution — “On‑Ramp to Archetypes first, Authoring last” sequence  

The "On-Ramp First" Macro-Structure: The specification is ordered to create a smooth cognitive ramp:
* It begins with an informal, non-normative Preface (The On-Ramp), which uses storytelling and concrete examples (System and Episteme) to build intuition.
* It then proceeds through the normative Parts (A-D), moving from the foundational kernel to the rich patterns of trans-disciplinary reasoning.
* It concludes with the authoring rules (Part E) and appendices, ensuring that this "meta" content does not obstruct the primary learning path.

1. **Preface (On‑Ramp)**  
   Informal tour; introduces `U.System` and `U.Episteme` via concrete
   stories before any normative language appears.

2. **Part A Kernel**  
   Minimal holonic ontology and the Transformer principle give readers
   the essential vocabulary.

3. **Part B Trans‑disciplinary Reasoning**  
   Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy: universal rule → Sys‑CAL example →
   KD‑CAL example.

4. **Part C Architheories**  
   Domain‑specific calculi expand on the examples already seen.

5. **Part D Ethics & Conflict Optimisation**  
   Shows reflective patterns only after readers grasp holonic reasoning.

6. **Part E Authoring**  
   Constitution, guard‑rails, and contributor rules come last; novices
   can postpone reading.

7. **Appendices (Annexes)**  
   Tutorials, tooling guides, and migration scripts live here.

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Narrative layer | First sight of `U.System` | First sight of `U.Episteme` |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Preface | Coffee‑machine story (pump as system). | Meta‑analysis story (study bundle as episteme). |
| Part A | Formal definition inherits boundary invariant. | Formal definition inherits F‑G‑R coordinates. |
| Part B Tell‑Show‑Show | Γ\_sys example: assemble pump. | Γ_epist example: merge study bundle. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑DA.1** | Each Part **SHALL** open with a one‑paragraph situational “hook” before formal text. |
| **CC‑DA.2** | Every `[A]` pattern **MUST** implement Tell‑Show‑Show: universal rule plus System & Episteme illustrations. |
| **CC‑DA.3** | Governance patterns (**Part E**) **SHALL NOT** appear before the Kernel in the main document flow. |

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Smooth learning curve; readers can stop at their needed depth. | Template discipline required; mitigated by authoring guide (E.8). |
| Reduces forward‑reference clutter; each concept is primed before formal use. | Preface evolves when new archetypes added; handled via On‑Ramp revision DRR. |

#### Rationale  
Educational research shows retention improves when abstract rules are
immediately paired with contrasting illustrations. By fixing the reading
order and mandating Tell‑Show‑Show inside every `[A]` pattern, FPF
embeds pedagogy into its architecture, realising Pillars **P‑2 Didactic
Primacy** and **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** without weakening rigour.

#### Relations  
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (GR‑1 ensures example jargon stays outside Core).  
* **Constrains:** Placement of all Parts, patterns, and appendices.  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2
  
###  E.7 · Archetypal Grounding Principle \[D]

#### Problem frame  
Universal rules are powerful only when readers can grasp them. In FPF the
Conceptual Core speaks in substrate‑agnostic language: `U.Holon`,
Γ‑aggregation, MHT emergence. Practitioners need to “see” those rules in
familiar matter—physical hardware or bodies of knowledge—before they can
reuse them.

#### Problem  
A purely abstract statement risks two failures:

1. **Didactic failure** – readers dismiss the pattern as “too meta,”
   violating Pillar **P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.  
2. **Unproven universality** – without cross‑domain instantiation the rule
   remains an untested claim.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Universality vs Concreteness** | Abstract law ↔ concrete example. |
| **Brevity vs Clarity** | Spec should stay concise ↔ dual examples add length. |
| **Rigour vs Accessibility** | Formal semantics ↔ intuitive narrative. |

#### Solution — mandatory *Archetypal Grounding* subsection  

Every architectural pattern (`[A]`) **SHALL** include a dedicated
section, titled exactly **“Archetypal Grounding,”** that *shows* how the
abstract law SCRs in FPF’s two canonical holon flavours:

1. **`U.System`** – the archetype of a **physical, operational holon**.  
2. **`U.Episteme`** – the archetype of an **abstract, epistemic holon**.

This enforces a repeatable **Tell‑Show‑Show** rhythm:

| Stage | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Tell** | `Solution` section states the universal rule. |
| **Show #1** | `Archetypal Grounding` – concrete `U.System` example. |
| **Show #2** | Same section – parallel `U.Episteme` example. |

#### Archetypal Grounding (of this pattern itself)

| Universal rule | `U.System` instantiation | `U.Episteme` instantiation |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| “Every `[A]` pattern requires grounding.” | Pattern *D.1 Algebra of Aggregation* illustrates Γ\_sys on assembling a water pump. | The same pattern illustrates Γ_epist on merging a meta‑analysis. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑AG.1** | Every architectural (`[A]`) pattern in Parts A, B, C, D, E **SHALL** contain a subsection headed exactly *“Archetypal Grounding”*. | Guarantees consistent Tell‑Show‑Show rhythm. |
| **CC‑AG.2** | The Archetypal Grounding subsection **MUST** illustrate the rule with both `U.System` *and* `U.Episteme`. | Demonstrates trans‑disciplinary reach. |
| **CC‑AG.3** | If a rule intentionally applies to only one substrate, the subsection **SHALL** state the scope limitation and justify it against the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`). | Prevents silent bias; links to Bias‑Audit guard‑rail. |
| **CC‑AG.4** | Patterns lacking a compliant Archetypal Grounding subsection **MAY NOT** progress to “Accepted” status. | Enforces discipline without referring to workflow mechanics. |

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Immediate clarity** – readers see abstract laws in action. | Patterns grow by one short table; mitigated by consistent template snippet. |
| **Proof of universality** – every rule is self‑documenting across substrates. | Authors must think cross‑domain; fosters richer patterns. |
| **Narrative cohesion** – recurring System/Episteme protagonists create a memorable storyline. | — |
|Built-in Proof of Universality: The specification consistently demonstrates its trans-disciplinary claims, building trust and credibility. | — |

#### Rationale  
Tell‑Show‑Show is a proven pedagogical sequence. By making it normative,
FPF hard‑codes **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** into the fabric of every `[A]`
pattern while still honouring **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**—the grounding
section replaces brittle ad‑hoc anecdotes with a disciplined dual
example. Linking scope‑justification to the five Principle lenses ties the
pattern to the **Taxonomy‑Guided Bias Audit** and keeps governance
language out of the Core.

#### Relations  

* **Implements macro flow:** `pat:authoring/didactic‑architecture` (E.6)  
* **References base types:** `pat:kernel/holon` (A.1) (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`)  
* **Interacts with bias guard‑rail:** `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E.5.4) via CC‑AG.3  
* **Constrains:** Authoring template in `pat:authoring/pattern‑template` (E.8)

###  E.8 · FPF Authoring Conventions & Style Guide   \[A]

#### Problem frame  
FPF grows through the addition of patterns written by authors from many
disciplines.  Without a shared structure *and* voice the framework would
fracture, violating Pillars **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** and
**P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.

#### Problem  
*Structural drift* and *stylistic fragmentation* threaten three qualities:

1. **Comparability** – readers cannot align patterns lacking common
   headings.  
2. **Narrative cohesion** – prose swings from dry jargon to informal
   blog style.  
3. **Auditability** – missing sections hide safety checks
   (Archetypal Grounding, Bias‑Annotation).

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Uniformity vs Expressiveness** | Consistent template ↔ freedom for diverse domains. |
| **Rigor vs Readability** | Formal precision ↔ engaging prose. |
| **Brevity vs Completeness** | Concise patterns ↔ mandated safety subsections. |

#### Solution — One template, enriched by style principles

Problem frame in alexandrian pattern canon historically called "context", FPF do not use this label due to overloading with Context a Plain label of a U.BoundedContext.

##### 2 · Stylistic Principles (S‑0 ... S‑13)

| # | Principle | Guideline |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| S‑0 | Narrative Seven-Step Heuristic | Authors are encouraged to structure major paragraphs or subsections using the seven‑step mnemonic |
| S‑1 | Density without Jargon | Short declarative sentences; tool names belong in Pedagogy/Tooling. |
| S‑2 | Internal Cohesion | Inline references to Pillars and related patterns. |
| S‑3 | Embedded Mini‑Definitions | Gloss a new term in parentheses on first appearance. |
| S‑4 | Contextualisation | Brief historical or disciplinary lineage anchors. |
| S‑5 | Prophylactic Clarification | Pre‑empt common misreadings inside the prose. |
| S‑6 | Quotable Closers | Finish Solution or Consequences with a memorable aphorism. |
| S‑7 | Generative over Prescriptive | Present rules as enabling constraints, not bureaucracy. |
| S‑8 | Trans‑disciplinary Tie‑ins | Illustrate using at least two distinct fields. |
| S‑9 | Physical Grounding Reference | Link abstractions to a `Transformer` or physical process. |
| S‑10 | Punchy Blocks | ≤ 5 sentences per paragraph; lists for clarity. |
| S‑11 | Narrative Flow | Ensure sections read as a continuous story, not bullet soup. |
| S‑12 | Full sentences over tags | Avoid “keyword soup”. Each list item MUST contain a subject and a verb; prefer 2–4 sentence micro‑paragraphs to bare tag lists. |
| S‑13 | SoTA‑Echo craft | In the SoTA‑Echoing section, present: **claim → practice → source → alignment → adoption status (adopt/adapt/reject)**; cite Bridges & CL when crossing Contexts/planes. |

Authors use the principles as a *scaffold*, not a straitjacket: the goal
is coherent, engaging insight.

** S-0 (Narrative Flow Heuristic) explanation**
Narrative flow recommended follow these steps: **Hook → Frame → Weave → Anchor → Bridge → Flow → Close**.

Brief explanations: 
| Step       | Purpose in a paragraph/section                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hook**   | Grab attention with a vivid image or paradox.              |
| **Frame**  | State the specific question or problem space.              |
| **Weave**  | Connect to earlier patterns or Pillars.                    |
| **Anchor** | Tie to a concrete System/Episteme or physical process.     |
| **Bridge** | Show the implication for the upcoming claim or rule.       |
| **Flow**   | Deliver the formal content or argument.                    |
| **Close**  | End with a quotable line or payoff that reinforces memory. |

Narrative Flow Heuristic also operationalises S‑1 (Density w/o Jargon), S‑2 (Internal Cohesion), S‑4 (Contextualisation), and S‑6 (Quotable Closers).

##### Autonomy authoring stub (mandatory when autonomy is claimed)
If a pattern or example claims **autonomy** for any Role/Method/Service:
1) Add a subsection **“Autonomy (RoC‑E.16)”** that lists:
   * `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef` (id, version, Scope (G), Γ_time),
   * `Aut-Guard policy-id`,
   * `OverrideProtocolRef` (SpeechAct names, SoD),
   * pointer to where **Green‑Gate** applies in the Method steps,
   * where **AutonomyLedgerEntry** is recorded on `U.Work`.
2) Include one **Tell‑Show‑Show** vignette that demonstrates **depletion** and **override** handling.
3) Use **LEX‑BUNDLE** terms (Scope (G), Γ_time, Role/Method/Work). Avoid “validity”, “process”, “actor” unless mapped to kernel types.

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Template element | `U.System` illustration | `U.Episteme` illustration |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Section order | Pump‑assembly pattern follows 1‑to‑11 headings. | Meta‑analysis pattern follows same headings. |
| S‑1 Density w/o Jargon | “The pump boundary is the sealing plane.” | “An episteme’s F‑score captures falsifiability.” |
| Hook‑Weave‑Anchor | Opens with field anecdote → links Γ‑core → anchors to motor torque. | Opens with historical paradox → links MHT → anchors to peer‑review data. |

#### SoTA‑Echoing  *(normative; lineage & deltas to contemporary State‑of‑the‑Art)*

**Purpose.** Make each pattern’s relationship to contemporary practice explicit and comparable without importing tooling or data governance. This section is prose‑first and notation‑independent.

**Minimum contents (obligations).**
1) **Sources (post‑2015).** Cite ≥ 3 primary SoTA sources (standards, seminal papers, widely‑used frameworks), at least **two independent Traditions** (per G‑cluster).  
2) **Practice alignment.** For each cited item, state **what is adopted, adapted, or rejected**, and **why** (in 2–4 sentences).  
3) **Scale legality.** If numeric operations are implied, **bind** them to **CG‑Spec** (Characteristic ids, Scale/Unit/Polarity, SCP/Γ‑fold) and declare partial‑order stance; **no scalarisation of partial orders**.  
4) **Cross‑Context reuse.** Any reuse across `U.BoundedContext` **SHALL** cite **Bridge id + CL** with loss notes; penalties route to **R_eff only** (F/G invariant). For plane crossings, publish **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** policy‑ids.  
5) **Lexical hygiene.** Do **not** use the verb/noun “mapping” outside E.10’s reserved sense; prefer **alignment**/**Bridge**/**relation** language.

**Writing guidance (readability).**
*Write short paragraphs, not tag lists.* For each Tradition, provide (a) a one‑sentence capsule of the practice, (b) a one‑sentence comparison to the pattern’s Solution, (c) a one‑sentence adoption status with reason. Where helpful, add one **System** and one **Episteme** micro‑example (Tell–Show–Show).

**Format: human‑first.** A small table is allowed, but each row **MUST** be accompanied by 1–2 sentences as above. Vendor/tool tokens, file formats, or data schemas are out of scope.

##### Conformance Checklist  

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑SG.1** | Every new pattern **SHALL** follow the section order defined in the Canonical Template (Context → … → Relations). | Guarantees structural comparability and machine‑parsing. |
| **CC‑SG.2** | Architectural patterns (`[A]`) **MUST** include an *Archetypal Grounding* section; Definitional patterns (`[D]`) **MAY** omit it **only** if the Bias‑Annotation states a domain‑specific scope. | Enforces Tell‑Show‑Show unless formally limited. |
| **CC‑SG.3** | The *Bias‑Annotation* section **SHALL** cite the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses and declare either “Universal” or an explicit scope limitation. | Keeps cross‑disciplinary neutrality explicit (ties to Guard‑Rail 4). |
| **CC‑SG.4** | Normative sentences **MUST** use keywords *SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *MUST*, *MAY* exactly as defined; synonyms are prohibited. | Prevents ambiguity for auditors and tooling. |
| **CC‑SG.5** | Pattern prose **SHOULD** demonstrate adherence to Style Principles **S‑0 … S‑13**; reviewers are empowered to request revision when clarity or didactic quality suffers. | Embeds common narrative voice without rigid policing. |
| **CC‑SG.6 (SoTA‑Echo required for `[A]`).** | Architectural patterns **SHALL** include a **SoTA‑Echoing** section as specified above; Definitional patterns **SHOULD** include it when cross‑disciplinary comparability is at issue. | Ensures contemporary situating of rules. |
| **CC‑SG.7 (Post‑2015, multi‑Tradition).** | SoTA‑Echoing **SHALL** cite ≥ 3 post‑2015 sources across ≥ 2 Traditions; each item **MUST** carry adoption status (adopt/adapt/reject) with reason. | Guards against monoculture; makes intent explicit. |
| **CC‑SG.8 (Bridge & CL on reuse).** | Any cross‑Context or plane reuse mentioned in SoTA‑Echoing **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL** and (if planes differ) **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** policy‑ids; penalties **→ R_eff** only. | Safe, auditable reuse. |
| **CC‑SG.9 (Lexical hygiene).** | The term **mapping** **SHALL NOT** appear in SoTA‑Echoing except in the precise E.10 sense; use **alignment/Bridge/relation** instead. | Avoids overloading reserved vocabulary. |
| **CC‑SG.10 (No keyword soup).** | SoTA‑Echoing items **MUST** be written as sentences (not bare noun phrases); bullet lists are acceptable only with complete clauses. | Improves didactic quality and comparability. |

##### Consequences  

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Predictable skeleton** – readers instantly know where to find context, forces, and criteria. | Limits author freedom in macro layout; mitigated by flexibility inside the Solution subsection. |
| **Cohesive voice** – S‑principles give FPF a recognisable style, aiding memorability. | Reviewers must read for style, not only semantics; checklists ease load. |
| **Embedded pedagogy** – Tell‑Show‑Show and Hook → Close heuristics turn the spec into a self‑teaching text. | Slightly longer patterns; justified by better comprehension and fewer clarifying DRRs. |

##### Rationale  
Structure and style function as FPF’s *grammar*. By unifying what were
once separate “template” and “style guide” patterns, authors face a
single reference point that satisfies:

* **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** – uniform, minimal surprises.  
* **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** – narrative flow, dual archetype examples.  
* Guard‑Rails 1 & 2 – no tool jargon, no notation lock‑in inside prose.

Optionality for `[D]` patterns preserves efficiency: purely invariant
definitions need not carry dual examples, yet must still justify the
omission via Bias‑Annotation—keeping pedagogy and neutrality explicit.

Conformance checklist often has name conformance criteria in international and industry standards, FPF name it so to easier adopt by engineers and managers.

##### Relations  

* **Implements:** `pat:authoring/didactic‑architecture` (E 6) & `pat:authoring/archetypal‑grounding` (E 7)  
* **Constrained by:** Guard‑Rails E 5.1‑E 5.4 (lexical firewall, notation independence, etc.)  
* **Constrains:** All future `NORM`, `A`, `D`, and `GOV` patterns; DRR template references the same section order.  

###  E.9 · Design‑Rationale Record (DRR) Method \[D]

#### Problem frame  
FPF is engineered for Pillar **P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution**: its normative
rules must adapt as new calculi and insights arrive. But change without a
record of *why* leads to conceptual erosion and undermines auditability.
Hence FPF requires an explicit **Design‑Rationale Record (DRR)**—a
durable *conceptual artefact* that precedes every normative change.

#### Problem  
Direct edits to the Core, absent a structured rationale, trigger three
systemic hazards:

1. **Lost provenance** – future authors cannot infer the reasoning behind
   a rule; intent decays.  
2. **Implicit assumptions** – discarded alternatives vanish from memory,
   so debates resurface and churn repeats.  
3. **Conceptual drift** – incremental tweaks slip past the Eleven Pillars
   and Principle Taxonomy lenses, blurring the framework’s foundations.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Rigour** | Evolve swiftly ↔ demonstrate deliberate, Pillar‑aligned decisions. |
| **Transparency vs Efficiency** | Provide a public argument trail ↔ avoid bureaucratic drag on minor edits. |
| **Clarity vs Conciseness** | Capture full reasoning ↔ prevent meta‑text from bloating the Core itself. |

#### Solution — the DRR as a structured argument  
Any proposal to add, modify or deprecate a `NORM`, `A`, `D`, or `GOV`
rule **MUST** be accompanied by a **Design‑Rationale Record** containing
exactly four conceptual components:

| Component | Guiding question | Typical content |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Problem frame** | *Why are we talking about this?* | Problem statement, triggering insight, or external change. |
| **Decision** | *What will we do?* | Precise normative text to enter the specification. |
| **Rationale** | *Why is this the right thing?* | Comparison of alternatives, Pillar check, taxonomy‑lens balance. |
| **Consequences** | *What happens next?* | Expected benefits, trade‑offs, impacted patterns, risk notes. |

The DRR lives **outside** the normative Core; only its *Decision* flows
into the specification upon acceptance, preserving Core brevity while
storing provenance.

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Holon flavour | DRR analogue | Four components illustrated |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **`U.System`** (physical) | Engineering Change Order for pump motor upgrade. | Context: inefficiency; Decision: switch to brushless DC; Rationale: energy gain vs cost; Consequences: new control schema + supplier change. |
| **`U.Episteme`** (knowledge) | Foundational theory revision paper. | Context: conflicting data; Decision: introduce new axiom; Rationale: explains legacy & new data, Pillar alignment; Consequences: fresh predictions, update to curricula. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑DRR.1** | Any change to a `NORM`, `A`, `D`, or `GOV` pattern **SHALL** be preceded by an accepted DRR containing Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences. | Prevents undocumented edits. |
| **CC‑DRR.2** | The *Rationale* element **MUST** assess the proposal against **all Eleven Pillars** and the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`). | Keeps evolution aligned and cross‑disciplinary. |
| **CC‑DRR.3** | The DRR **SHALL** list every pattern it supersedes, amends, or risks impacting. | Maintains explicit impact graph. |
| **CC‑DRR.4** | Once approved, only the *Decision* text is inserted into the Core; other DRR sections **SHALL NOT** migrate into normative prose. | Preserves Core brevity; provenance remains external. |
| **CC‑DRR.5** | Minor, non‑substantive edits (e.g., typos) **MAY** follow a lightweight DRR variant containing Context + Decision only, provided they do not alter semantics. | Allows efficiency without eroding rigour. |
| ^^CC‑DRR.6 (LAT pointer)** | For Δ‑2/Δ‑3 changes to part F or part G patterns, the DRR SHALL include a non‑normative pointer (id/URI) to a published LEX‑AUTH Trace (LAT) archived as U.Work; the LAT is evidence, not normative prose.

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Complete audit trail** – every normative change carries a structured “why”. | Adds deliberate friction; mitigated by CC‑DRR.5 for trivial fixes. |
| **Higher decision quality** – Pillar & lens check surfaces hidden conflicts early. | Authors must learn taxonomy; template checklist shortens ramp‑up. |
| **Institutional memory** – prevents re‑litigation of rejected alternatives. | DRR archive grows; index stored in a non‑normative annex. |

#### Rationale  
A legal code evolves by amendments, not by editing the statute in place;
FPF adopts the same discipline. The DRR embodies **P‑10 Open‑Ended
Evolution** while protecting **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**: the Core remains
succinct, yet its evolution is fully transparent. Coupling the argument
to the Pillars and taxonomy lenses aligns each change with FPF’s
constitution and Guard‑Rails, without prescribing tooling workflows.

#### Relations  

* **Instantiates:** P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution, P‑2 Didactic Primacy  
* **Template governed by:** `pat:authoring/pattern‑template` (E 8)  
* **Interacts with:** `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E 5.4) via lens check  
* **Complemented by:** `pat:authoring/code‑of‑conduct` (E 12) – etiquette for DRR debate  

# E.10 — LEX‑BUNDLE*: Unified Lexical Rules for FPF (Registers, Naming, and Forbidden Forms) \[A]
*Definitional pattern \[D]; normative for all Core/Architheory text and for any Context that claims FPF conformance.*

**Status & placement.** Part E.10 (“Lexical Discipline & Stratification”); complements **E.10.D1 (D.CTX)**, **E.10.D2 (I/D/S)**, and **E.11 (Authoring‑Tier Scheme)**, and is referenced by F‑cluster naming practices (F.4–F.8). This bundle consolidates all lexical constraints in one place so authors can cite **“LEX‑BUNDLE”** instead of listing rules scattered across documents.

**Builds on:** A.7 **Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)**; E.5 Guard‑Rails (DevOps Lexical Firewall; Notational Independence; Unidirectional Dependency); F.5 **Naming Discipline for U.Types & Roles**.
**Coordinates with.** A.2/A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment), A.10 (Evidence Graph Referring), B.1/B.3 (Γ‑algebras & assurance), F‑cluster (context of meaning; Bridges).

## 1 · Problem context

**Intent.** Provide one **normative** rule‑set that makes FPF language **unambiguous, composable across contexts, and teachable** by design. Authors, reviewers, and tooling can point to **LEX‑BUNDLE** as the single source of truth for:

* **Vertical stratification** (Kernel ↔ Architheory ↔ Context ↔ Instance);
* **Twin registers** (Tech/Plain) with safe synonyms;
* **Naming morphology** (allowed suffixes & style) for the kernel’s core objects;
* **Minimal Generality** tests (names are neither parochial nor vacuous);
* **Canonical rewrites** for overloaded words (e.g., *process*, *function*, *service*);
* **Conformance checks** (lintable) and minimal examples.

**Scope.** Applies to:
(a) **Core** (Parts A–G), (b) **Architheory specs** (CAL/LOG/CHR), (c) **Context glossaries** that claim FPF conformity, and (d) **Diagrams/prose** in normative text. It **does not** constrain Tooling or Pedagogy wording other than where they quote Core semantics.

---

## 2 · Problem 

1. **Polysemy drift.** *Process, function, service, agent, activity* slide between structure, recipe, execution, and promise.
2. **Cross‑context collision.** A label (e.g., *Owner*) is assumed “global” though meanings differ per `U.BoundedContext`.
3. **Name bloat vs. parochialism.** Either hyper‑specific domain names leak into core types, or vague umbrella names obscure invariants.
4. **I/D/S collapse.** Authors mix **intension** (the thing), **description** (how we describe it), and **specification** (testable criteria).
5. **Register soup.** Tech terms bleed into Plain pedagogy and vice‑versa, inviting category errors.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Universality vs. local fit** | Kernel must stay universal while allowing domain nuance in a Context of meaning.              |
| **Brevity vs. clarity**        | Short names help, but only if morphology signals the right kernel slot.                    |
| **Stability vs. evolution**    | Names should survive refactors; yet we must accommodate new roles/types without explosion. |
| **Pedagogy vs. precision**     | Plain words aid learners; Tech labels anchor formal checks.                                |

## 4 · Solution — the **LEX‑BUNDLE** rule‑set (overview)

**LEX‑BUNDLE** aka **ULR (Unified Lexical Rules)** is a compact set of **register, naming, and rewrite** rules with conformance checks.

1. **Vertical Stratification Ladder** (E.10 → four strata);
2. **Twin‑Register Discipline** (Tech/Plain pairs);
3. **Minimal Generality (MG)** principle + tests;
4. **Morphology & Style** (suffixes, casing, reserved prefixes);
5. **Canonical Rewrites** for overloaded words (L‑rules);
6. **Conformance Checklist (CC‑LEX)** and **Regression Stubs (RSCR‑LEX)**.

Below are the **normative clauses** 

## 5 · Vertical Stratification Ladder (four strata; no cross‑bleed)

> **Rule V‑0 (Strata).** Every lexical item in a conformant text belongs to exactly one **stratum**:

1. **Kernel** — `U.*` types, kernel relations, invariants (e.g., `U.Holon`, `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Work`, `U.Service`).
2. **Architheory** — CAL/LOG/CHR exports (e.g., **Sys‑CAL**, **KD‑CAL**, **Agency‑CHR**) that **extend** but do not override Kernel.
3. **Context** — a **`U.BoundedContext`** with its **Glossary, Invariants, Roles**, and **Bridges** (local Context of meaning).
4. **Instance** — concrete identifiers (holders, role assignments, works, carriers).

**V‑1 (Unidirectional meaning).** Meaning **flows downward** only: Kernel → Architheory → Context → Instance. No stratum may redefine a higher stratum’s term; it may only **specialise** or **bridge** it.

**V‑2 (Strata vs authoring tiers).** The **Authoring‑Tier Scheme (E.11)** classifies **Work** acts (AT0…AT3) and **MUST NOT** be conflated with the four **lexical strata** above. Strata constrain **tokens**; tiers classify **acts** and publication discipline.

**V‑3 (Citation style).** When a Context term is used, its **Context** must be visible at first mention (e.g., `OwnerRole:ITIL_2020`). If an author needs Cross‑context reuse, they **MUST** cite a **Bridge** with a stated **Congruence Level (CL)** (see F.9).

**V‑4 (Firewall).** Tooling/Pedagogy idioms shall not leak into Kernel prose (DevOps Lexical Firewall). CI/CD jargon, file formats, or API names **MUST NOT** appear in Core definitions. (Pedagogy may use them **as examples** only, in the **Plain** register, with Tech anchors present.)

## 6 · Ontology Guards 

### 6.1 Tech register ontology guards

> **Purpose.** This section stabilises the Tech register of the kernel lexicon by enforcing head‑anchored naming, explicit *object‑of‑talk*, I/D/S morphology, disciplined treatment of **Role / Holder**, and Domain usage consistent with **D.CTX** and **UTS**. It aligns with **F.4 Role Description (RCS/RSG)**, **F.11 Method Quartet Harmonisation**, and **F.17 UTS**. **Scope:** Guidance is **register‑agnostic** and applies to the whole FPF; examples are illustrative and MUST pass Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (MG·DA) and other rules of lexical governance pattern E*. This guidance applies to kernel and non‑kernel components (including Part G and patterns in Part C) and SHOULD be reused across extensions.
> 
**Onto1 — Head‑anchoring**  *(use Kernel heads + pass LEX.TokenClass / I/D/S gates)*
* **Rule:** The **head noun of a term MUST explicitly signal the kind** (`System`, `Holon`, `Role`, `Work`, `Episteme`, `Tradition`, `Lineage`, `Characteristic`, `Method`, `Profile`, `Description`, `Spec`, `Flow`, `Card`, `Pack`, `Dashboard`, …).
* **Figurative heads** with obvious overload (“Tradition”, “family”, “process”, “function”) are **forbidden in the kernel**. Use **plain twins** only with a 1:1 Tech mapping and declare **`LEX.TokenClass`** for the Tech token. They **MAY** appear **only in the Plain register** as 1:1 twin‑mappings to a Tech token, but **MUST NOT** appear in the Tech register. Plain language should minimise lexical error from overloaded terms; use plain‑twin lexical guards.
  * ***Do:** `IncidentDashboard`, `MethodSpec`, `TraditionProfile`, `FlowDescription`.
* ***Don’t:** `IncidentBoard`, `TDD Tradition`, `Production Process` (kernel), `Service Function` (kernel).

 **Onto2 — I/D/S on the surface (Intension/Description/Specification morphology)**  *(ref. E.10.D2)*
* **Rule:** Any **intensional** object is a bare head: `Method`, `Tradition`, `Characteristic`. Any **description** appends **`…Description`**: `MethodDescription`, `TraditionDescription`. Any **testable specification** appends **`…Spec`** and presupposes acceptance criteria and harnesses (normative in **E.10.D2**). E.g., *Algorithm* is a species of `MethodDescription` for a computer (a system in the role of information transformer); **If** expressed in a formal language **and** bundled with acceptance tests, it is **`MethodSpec`** (per **F.11**). **If** expressed as pseudo‑code, it is **`MethodDescription`**.
* **Extension:** Apply the same pattern to non‑method objects where appropriate: `FlowDescription`/`FlowSpec`, `SystemDescription`/`SystemSpec`.
* **Do:** `SamplingMethod` · `SamplingMethodDescription` · `SamplingMethodSpec`.
* **Don’t:** `SamplingAlgorithm` (when it is just prose), `SamplingProcessSpec` (head not signalling kind).

**Onto3 — Roles, Holders, and Carriers (holonic)**  *(ref. F.4 / F.5)*
* **Rule:** The playable intention is named **`…Role`** and described through **F.4 Role Description** (RCS/RSG), e.g., `SafetyOfficerRole`, `ReviewerRole`. The party **assuming a role** is the **Holder**. Use the **`Holder#Role:Context`** pattern to type the assumption (where `Context` is a `U.BoundedContext`), e.g., `Team‑Alpha (U.Holon) is Holder#SafetyOfficerRole:Plant‑Ops`. **Carrier** is **reserved for a system that bears a symbol of episteme** (`U.Episteme`, `Tradition`, `Lineage`, `Profile`, repertoire) **independent of any concrete role assumption**, e.g., `LeanTraditionCarrier`, `CalibrationLineageCarrier`. Avoid **`Artefact`** as a head in the kernel: it is ambiguous between a Carrier (e.g., document), a system “made by” some transformer, or an episteme abstracted from its carrier.
* **Register note:** Job titles (`Reviewer`, `Owner`, `Lead`) belong in the **Plain** register and MUST twin‑map to explicit Tech `…Role` tokens.
* **Why:** This resolves the inconsistent “role carrier vs role holder” usage: **use “Holder” for holonic role assumption**, keep **“Carrier”** for the *system that bears a symbol of episteme*. 
* **Migration note.** Legacy `…CarrierRole` **MUST be rewritten** to `Holder#…Role:Context`. Use SCR‑LEX to enforce the rewrite.
* **Do:** `ReviewerRole` (or `AssessorRole`), `Holder#ReviewerRole:Journal‑Issue‑42` (or `Holder#AssessorRole:Procurement‑Lot‑42`); `LeanTraditionCarrier (U.Holon)`, independent of any particular role.
**Don’t:** `Reviewer` (as a kernel type), `ReviewerCarrier` (to mean a role holder), `SystemReviewer` (role collapsed into a type).

**Onto4 — Domain only as a catalog mark**  *(ref. E.10.D1 D.CTX; publish stitching on UTS)*
* **Rule:** `Domain` is **not a kernel kind** and carries **no semantics, inheritance, or reasoning rights**. It is a **catalog mark** that groups several `U.BoundedContext` entries.
* **Required stitching (see D.CTX & UTS).** Any use of `Domain` **MUST** present: 1. the enumerated list of `ContextId` in **D.CTX**, and 2. the corresponding **UTS strings** (F.17) with twin labels.
* **“Discipline ≠ Domain.”** _Domain_ labels are **catalog‑only (D.CTX + UTS)**; **Discipline** is a **CG‑Spec‑governed holon** (`U.Discipline`). Cross‑use requires **Bridge (F.9) + CL**; **LexicalCheck** MUST fail texts that equate Domain with Discipline.
* **Governance.** **No “Domain … governance”.** Rules of comparability/aggregation belong to **Discipline/CG‑Spec** (Gauge, MinimalEvidence, Γ‑fold, CL‑routing), *not* to `Domain`. Prefer `DomainFamily` + stitching over inventing new “Domain” types.
* **Do:** `DomainBundle: ClinicalSafety → {ContextId: AdverseEvents, DeviceLabelling, …} + UTS twins`.
* **Don’t:** `ClinicalSafetyDomain` as a type with inheritance; `Domain Governance` sections in Tech.

**Onto5 — Always state the **object‑of‑talk**
* **Rule.** The definition or first line of a gloss **MUST state what the term is about**: a `U.Holon`/`U.System`, a `U.Episteme` (`Tradition`, `Lineage`, `Profile`), a `Role`, a `Work` execution, a `Characteristic`, or a `Carrier`.
* **Do:** “**Object‑of‑talk:** `ReviewerRole` — a role intention playable by a holon within an editorial context.”
* **Don’t:** “Reviewer — a person who …” (blurs kind and object‑of‑talk).

**Onto6 — Bans and canonical rewrites**  *(mirror E.10 § 9 L‑rules; do not duplicate tables)*
* `process / function / activity` → **`Work` / `MethodDescription` / `Flow`** (context‑dependent).
* `Tradition` → **`Tradition`** (Tech); leave “Tradition” only as a Plain twin with an adjacent Tech label.
* `domain` → **`DomainFamily` + {ContextId list} + UTS twins**.
* legacy `…CarrierRole` → **`Holder#…Role:Context`**.
* ambiguous `Owner` in role names → prefer **`StewardRole` / `CustodianRole` / explicit responsibility head**.
* job titles (`owner`, `lead`, `champion`) in the kernel → **use explicit `…Role` names**; keep titles in Plain with twin‑labels.
* **Do:** `FlowDescription: ReturnsHandling`, `Tradition: Test‑Driven`, `Holder#CustodianRole:Asset‑Ledger`.
* **Don’t:** `Returns Process`, `TDD Tradition` (kernel), `Ledger Owner` (underspecified).

**Worked mini‑examples across arenas**
1. **Software engineering:** `BuildFlowDescription`, `CIHarnessSpec`; `Holder#MaintainerRole:Repo‑X`. Avoid `Build Process`, `Repo Owner`.
2. **Applied research / experimentation:** `SamplingMethodSpec`, `CalibrationLineageCarrier`; `Holder#ReviewerRole:Grant‑Call‑Y`.  Avoid `Sampling Algorithm` (if prose), `Lab Owner`.
3. **Production / service management:** `ShiftWork`, `SafetyOfficerRole`; `Holder#SafetyOfficerRole:Plant‑Ops`.  Avoid `Safety Officer` as a type, `SafetyDomain Governance`.
4. **Operations research / optimisation:**  `RoutingMethodDescription`, `CostCharacteristic`; `Holder#ModelStewardRole:OR‑Program`.  Avoid `Routing Function`, `Model Owner`.
5. **Healthcare / clinical ops:** `CarePathwayFlowDescription`, `MedicationAdministrationWork`; `Holder#AttendingPhysicianRole:Ward‑12`. Avoid `Care Process`, `Ward Owner`.
6. **Finance & accounting:** `ReconciliationMethodSpec`, `JournalPostingWork`; `Holder#TreasuryStewardRole:Liquidity‑Book`. Avoid `Reconciliation Process`, `Account Owner` (underspecified).
7. **Legal / compliance:** `RetentionPolicySpec`, `InvestigationWork`; `Holder#DataProtectionOfficerRole:Org‑X`. Avoid `Compliance Function`, `Data Owner` (underspecified).
8. **Cloud / IT operations:** `IncidentFlowDescription`, `RunbookMethodSpec`; `Holder#OnCallEngineerRole:Service‑Y`. Avoid `Incident Process`, `Service Owner` (underspecified).
9. **Logistics / supply chain:** `PickingWork`, `RoutingMethodSpec`; `Holder#DispatcherRole:Hub‑Z`. Avoid `Picking Process`, `Fleet Owner`.
10. **Construction / civil engineering:** `PermitAcquisitionFlowDescription`, `InspectionMethodSpec`; `Holder#SiteStewardRole:Project‑Lot‑17`. Avoid `Inspection Process`, `Site Owner`.
11. **Emergency response:** `TriageMethodDescription`, `EvacuationFlowDescription`; `Holder#IncidentCommanderRole:Event‑R`. Avoid `Triage Function`, `Incident Owner`.
12. **Agriculture:** `IrrigationFlowDescription`, `SoilSamplingMethodSpec`; `Holder#FieldStewardRole:Plot‑17`. Avoid `Irrigation Process`, `Field Owner`.

**Checklist before minting a KernelToken**
* Head noun signals kind (Onto1).
* I/D/S morphology correct (Onto2).
* If role‑related: **Role vs Holder vs Carrier** separation observed; holonic scope explicit (Onto3).
* Any Domain mention stitched to D.CTX and UTS; **no norms on Domain** (Onto4, Onto6).
* Object‑of‑talk declared (Onto5).
* SCR‑LEX rewrites checked / legacy forms migrated (Onto6).
> **Note on registers.** Keep figurative or business‑casual terms in the **Plain** register only, with strict **twin‑label** links to the Tech token (LEX‑BUNDLE). In the **Tech** register, speak in KL‑CAL: **episteme‑about‑epistemes** (Tradition, Lineage, Profile), not in catalogue‑admin idioms.

* **Onto‑Deon — Deontic lexicon guard (Core register)**  
 **Rule.** In the Conceptual Core, avoid **“Standard/Standardual”** unless the object is an explicit **deontic speech‑act** under the **Gov** lens (cf. E.3). For interface/boundary invariants and public commitments of **things** (holons, interfaces, ports), prefer **standard**, **interface standard**, or **compliance profile**.  Standard is a Description or Specification. If you have standard, check a name of an intensional object: is it true name that compliant with this pattern guards? If not, change a name for a proper intensional name and then add "standard" as "description with intended compliance checks".
 **Rewrite hints (Tech → Tech).**  
 `publication Standard` → `publication standard`;  
 `frame Standard` → `frame standard`;  
 `measurement Standard` → `measurement standard`;  
 `Method Interface Standard (MIC)` → `Method Interface Standard (MIS)` *(alias acceptable during transition)*;  
 `Boundary‑Inheritance Standard (BIC)` → `Boundary‑Inheritance Standard (BIS)` *(alias acceptable during transition)*.  
 **Rationale.** Keeps Core prose centred on **intensional objects** and their boundary invariants; reserves deontic obligations for governance contexts and **U.Service**‑like promises. Do **not** misuse “plane”: deontic speech‑acts are analysed via the **Gov** lens, while **ReferencePlane** remains `{world | concept | episteme}`.

## 6.2 Twin‑Register Discipline (Tech / Plain)

**Plain twin (LEX).** A registry entry pairing the **authoritative Tech label** with a **display‑only Plain label** for one `U.Type` **in one `U.BoundedContext`**; governed by **PTG (Plain Twin Governance; in the LEX registry)** and referenced by `Twin‑Map ID (LEX)`. *“Plain twin” ≠ the **Plain register** (the register is where twins may be used; the twin is the 1:1 mapping).*
**Convention.** In this spec, **Plain** (capitalized) names the register; **plain twin** (lowercase) names the 1:1 mapping entry.

> **Rule R‑0 (Registers).** Every Kernel and Architheory concept has a **Tech label** (the testable semantic token) and an optional **Plain label** (didactic synonym). The **Tech label is authoritative**; the Plain label is permitted *only* in expository text and must map 1:1 to the Tech meaning inside the current **Context**.

### 6.2.1 Allowed pairs (normative table; examples)

| **Tech (authoritative)** | **Plain (didactic)**                        | **Notes & guards**                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `U.System`               | system, machine, team                        | “Service” **never** stands for `U.System`; reserve **Service** for `U.Service` (see L‑SERV). Avoid “service‑instance” as a Plain twin; prefer “system instance” if needed. |
| `U.Episteme`             | body of knowledge, document, dataset, model | Pair must respect **Carrier vs Content** (A.7).                                              |
| `U.Method`               | how‑to, procedure (abstract)                | Do **not** call this “process” (L‑PROC).                                                     |
| `U.MethodDescription`    | recipe, SOP, playbook, code, spec‑text      | If testable, call out **Spec** explicitly per E.10.D2 (I/D/S).                               |
| `U.Work`                 | run, execution, activity, job, case         | Never use “process” or “procedure” here.                                                     |
| `U.Role`                 | role, hat, mask                             | Always **context‑indexed** per D.CTX.                                                        |
| `U.Service`              | promise, offering, external Standard        | Never equate to provider system or API (L‑SERV).                                             |
| `U.Capability`           | ability, capacity (within bounds)           | Separate from Role/Method/Work; must carry **envelope & measures**.                          |
| `U.Dynamics`             | law of change, model of evolution           | Not a capability or a method.                                                                |

**R‑1 (Plain first‑use).** At first use in a section, show **Tech label** and (optionally) the Plain twin: *“…a `U.Method` (the **how‑to**), described by a `U.MethodDescription` (the **recipe**) …”*
**R‑2 (No unpaired Plain in CC).** Conformance Checklists must use **Tech labels** only.

Domains can mint aliases inside their `U.BoundedContext` glossary; all aliases must map 1:1 to a Tech label (**SenseCell** row in the Context’s **Concept-Set Table**), and if exported across Contexts, via an **Alignment Bridge** (with **CL/Loss**).

 Make “plain twins” (reader‑friendly labels) **safe by construction**, not just style. The plain twin must **not** change kind, scope, or reader expectations versus the canonical Tech name; it is **display‑only** and **context‑local**.

* **Tech name (tech)** — the canonical, kernel‑conformant label used in **normative** clauses (e.g., `U.RoleAssignment`, `TransformerRole`).
* **Plain twin (plain)** — a didactic **display alias** permitted in **expository** prose and UI surfaces **inside one `U.BoundedContext`**.

> **Principle:** *Meaning lives in the Tech name; the plain twin may never move meaning.* (Locality is enforced by `U.BoundedContext` and Bridges.)

### 6.2.2 Plain Twin Safety constraints (normative)

**CC‑TWIN‑1 · One‑to‑one & local.**
Each Tech name has **at most one** plain twin **per `U.BoundedContext`**; the same plain twin **MUST NOT** point at more than one Tech name in the same Context.

**CC‑TWIN‑2 · Sense‑equivalence proof.**
A plain twin **MUST** bind to the **same SenseCell** as its Tech name in that Context (F.3/F.7). Authors **MUST** record at least one **counter‑example test** showing how the twin could be misread and why it still passes **in this Context** (SenseCell notes).

**CC‑TWIN‑3 · Head‑term discipline (HND).**
The plain twin **MUST** preserve the **head term** of the Tech name, or append an explicit bracketed head on **first use**:

* Roles keep **“(role)”**, Services keep **“(service)”**, Methods keep **“(method)”**, Work keeps **“(work record)”**, Capability keeps **“(capability)”**.
  *Examples:*
  `TransformerRole` → “**Transformer (role)**”,
  `U.Service` → “**Service (service)**”,
  `U.Work` → “**work (work record)**”.

**CC‑TWIN‑4 · Kind‑consistent.**
A plain twin **MUST NOT** map across **Kinds** (C.3). If the twin’s everyday reading could denote a different Kind (e.g., *Tradition* = organization, corpus, domain), it is **forbidden** unless qualified by a bracketed head and **Context gloss** on first use (see CC‑TWIN‑7).

 **CC‑TWIN‑5 · Ambiguity stop‑list.**
The following base nouns are **reserved** and **MUST NOT** be used as unqualified plain twins: *Tradition, service, process, function, model, system, method, standard, library, dataset, evidence, activity, task, action*.
They are allowed **only** with an explicit head per **CC‑TWIN‑3** and a **Context gloss** (CC‑TWIN‑7). *(This list MAY be extended in the registry.)*

**CC‑TWIN‑6 · No cross‑context by label.**
Plain twins are **not portable**. Reuse in another `U.BoundedContext` requires a **Bridge** with CL and loss notes; names alone carry no authority.

**CC‑TWIN‑7 · First‑use gloss.**
At first occurrence in a document or screen, a plain twin **MUST** be shown as **“Plain twin \[Tech name] — Context gloss”**, e.g.:
“**Transformer (role)** \[**TransformerRole**] — *mask borne by a system to enact a method step in OR\_2025*”.

**CC‑TWIN‑8 · Normative surface ban.**
Plain twins **MUST NOT** appear in **Conformance Checklists, predicates, type signatures, or acceptance clauses**. Only Tech names are normative. (Plain twins are strictly didactic.)

**CC‑TWIN‑9 · Twin budget.**
**At most one** plain twin per Tech name per Context. Synonym piles are prohibited (control vocabulary sprawl; see F.14).

**CC‑TWIN‑10 · Registry entry & DRR.** 
Every plain twin **MUST** have a **registry entry** (in the LEX registry) recording: `tech`, `plain`, `context`, `head`, **SenseFidelity = {3,2,1,0}**, ambiguity notes, counter‑examples, DRR id. Any change requires a **DRR**. 

**CC‑TWIN‑11 · Tests.**
 Twin entries **MUST** pass the **Twin Harness** (see F.15): *Head term*, *Kind consistency*, *SenseCell match*, *Stop‑list compliance*, and *First‑use gloss*.

## 7 · Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (MG·DA) — names neither parochial nor vacuous

> **Principle (MG·DA).** A minted name is **as general as necessary and no more**, and its **head noun is anchored to the object‑of‑talk**. First classify the **NameToken (name of a concept: term, lexical unit) itself** using **`LEX.TokenClass`**, then apply the guardrails corresponding to that class: kernel tokens must unify **across domains**; discriminator/context tokens must make the **domain legible** *from the name itself*. Names too general to have obvious domain are **banned**. 

### 7.1 `LEX.TokenClass` (meta‑lexical; not a USM Scope)
**Definition.** `LEX.TokenClass : NameToken → {KernelToken | ContextToken | DiscriminatorToken}`.  
This is a **Characteristic on NameTokens** (symbols), used by the LEX registry and MG·DA lints.
It is **not** a USM scope and carries **no** truth/validity semantics.

### 7.2 `KernelToken` — Minimal Generality (MG‑K)
**MG‑K1 (Tri‑domain witness, MUST).** Maintain a DRR/Glossary note with **≥ 3 heterogeneous arenas** where the invariants hold (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, cloud ops). If you cannot, narrow to a Context name or move qualifiers into **RCS** (Role Characterisation Space).
**MG‑K2 (No parochial nouns, MUST).** Kernel names **MUST NOT** contain domain nouns (*Ticket, Microservice, Patient, Developer*). Such nouns belong in **Context** or as **RCS Characteristics**.
**MG‑K3 (No vacuity, MUST).** Avoid vacuous heads (*Thing, Event, Process, Resource*). Use existing kernel heads (`U.Holon`, `U.Work`, `U.Method`, `U.Resrc`, …).
**MG‑K4 (Intent over mechanism, MUST).** Kernel type/role names encode **intent**, not mechanism. Mechanisms (algorithms, hardware form, recipe flavors) live in **RCS** or **Capability**.
**MG‑K5 (Notation independence, SHOULD).** The intensional meaning is separable from any one notation/toolchain.
**MG‑K6 (Refactoring safety, MUST).** If a name fails MG, do **not** mutate it silently. Record a DRR and apply F.13 **Lexical Continuity & Deprecation** (aliases; Bridges for Cross‑context mappings).

### 7.3 `DiscriminatorToken` / `ContextToken` — Domain Anchoring (DA‑D)
**DA‑D1 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring, MUST).** The head noun names the **object being classified** (e.g., *Sense*, *Context*, *Role*, *Bridge*, *Characteristic*). Readers can answer “**X of what?**” without external context.
**DA‑D2 (Characteristic, not axis, MUST).** Enumerated properties are named as **Characteristic**  within a **CharacteristicSpace** (MM‑CAL). Avoid spatial metaphors (*axis, dimension, plane, lane, tier, layer*) unless the metaphor is a **pattern‑defined primitive** in this spec.
**DA‑D3 (Enum clarity, MUST).** If the term denotes an enumeration, (a) the value set is **small and closed**, (b) membership criteria are obvious from the definition, (c) the **object‑of‑talk** is explicit in the name (e.g., `SenseFamily`, not bare *Family*, *RowPlane* or overly general *Facet*).
**DA‑D4 (Anti‑recipe, MUST).** Do not bake *how‑to* or local methods into discriminator names; those belong in `U.Method/MethodDescription` or **Capability**.
**DA‑D5 (Mapping discipline, MUST).** Cross‑context readings go through a **Bridge** (F.9). Discriminator names must not suggest global identity.
**DA‑D6 (Register discipline, SHOULD).** Keep normative tokens stable; synonyms live in **Plain** register only and must not appear in constraints/tests.
**DA‑D7 (Ban generic combinators, MUST).** Reject vague composites like *NameUseMode*, *NamingScope*, *RowFacet/RowPlane/RowLane*. Each candidate must pass **DA‑D1** and **DA‑D3** (object‑anchored head and explicit **CharacteristicSpace**).

### 7.4 Global tests (apply after 7.2/7.3)
**MG·DA‑T1 (Three‑arena witness).** If **`LEX.TokenClass`(t)=KernelToken**, you **MUST** provide the tri‑domain witnesses (7.2‑MG‑K1). Otherwise this is **SHOULD** (document at least one contrasting arena).
**MG·DA‑T2 (Object‑of‑talk).** The head noun uniquely signals the subject area; avoid free‑floating metaphors. **MG·DA‑T3 (Anti‑recipe).** Remove mechanism/implementation words; relocate to Method/Capability/RCS.
**MG·DA‑T4 (Enum clarity).** For enumerations, list the closed value set and its CharacteristicSpace.
**MG·DA‑T5 (Collision & Uniqueness, MUST).** Before merge, run a **full‑text search** over the corpus and the **Reserved‑Names registry**. The candidate **MUST NOT** collide with any existing token used in another sense anywhere in FPF. If a collision exists, either rename or raise a DRR to deprecate the prior token.
**MG·DA‑T6 (Teaching swap).** In didactic prose (E.10.D2), the term can be swapped in **without caveats**. 
**MG·DA‑T7 (Intensional ground, MUST).** The definition card states the intensional criterion for membership explicitly; reviewers can check membership without reading external narrative.

### 7.5 Compatibility with USM (how tokens and scopes meet)
**USM applies to acts, not tokens.** Mint/rename/use are **LexicalActs** that carry a USM scope. `LEX.TokenClass` constrains **where** a token may be used via an **AllowedScopes** policy:
**Conformance rule.** For any usage `u` of a token `t`: `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(u) ∈ AllowedScopes(c).`

The LEX registry defines `AllowedScopes(c)` (e.g., `KernelToken` usage in normative kernel constraints is allowed; in Plain register outside a glossary is restricted; Context emissions of `KernelToken` require a Bridge/alias, etc.).

**Audit.** Violations are flagged as **SCR‑LEX‑Sxx** (see acceptance tests below).

### 7.6 Metaphor guidance (non‑binding heuristics)
Prefer **object‑anchored heads** to metaphors. If a metaphor is unavoidable, ensure it is (a) explicitly defined by a pattern here, and (b) unambiguous within the **NameClass**. Example families (use sparingly):
* **Progression metaphors** (*level, tier, ladder*): only where a **gate/upgrade** is defined by the pattern.  
* **Separation metaphors** (*lane, track*): only where parallel, non‑interfering flows are enforced by rules.  
* **Grouping metaphors** (*family, class*): only for **small, closed enumerations** attached to a clearly named object‑of‑talk (e.g., `SenseFamily` rather than bare *Family*).

### 7.7 Short‑form and acronym discipline
**SF‑1 (First expansion, MUST).** On first use, expand the term; place the short‑form in parentheses (e.g., “Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (**MG·DA**)”).  
**SF‑2 (Uniqueness, MUST).** Register short‑forms in the **Reserved‑Names** list; run the collision check (7.4‑MG·DA‑T5).  
**SF‑3 (Form, SHOULD).** Prefer typographic separators (**MG·DA**) to fused acronyms (**MGDA**). Use the fused form only in code or identifiers where punctuation is disallowed, and only after registration.

### 7.8 Examples (illustrative, canonical)
Prefer **`U.Service`** (promise) over *BusinessService*; **`U.Capability`** over *Function*; **`U.Dynamics`** over *NaturalProcess*; **`U.WorkPlan`** over *ScheduleProcess*.  
Do **not** mint *ETLService* at kernel level—model ETL as `MethodDescription`; the **Service** is “data delivered under acceptance.”

### 7.9 Acceptance & regression checks (LEX/USM)
**SCR‑LEX‑S01 (TokenClass declaration).** Every normative token has a declared `LEX.TokenClass`.
**SCR‑LEX‑S02 (Collision & uniqueness).** Full‑text + Reserved‑Names check passes (no other meaning in FPF).
**SCR‑LEX‑S03 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring).** Heads name the object classified (DA‑D1).
**SCR‑LEX‑S04 (CharacteristicSpace).** Enumerations declare their value set and space (DA‑D2/3).
**SCR‑LEX‑S05 (USM compatibility).** For each LexicalAct, `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)`.
**SCR‑LEX‑S06 (Slot/Ref suffix discipline).** Any token with suffix **`…Slot`** or **`…Ref`** is either (a) a **SlotKind**/**RefKind** declared under A.6.5, or (b) a episteme field whose type is a RefKind; no ValueKind or other type class may end with these suffixes.
**RSCR‑LEX‑E01 (Banned generics).** Reject tokens matching the banned combinators list (DA‑D7).
**RSCR‑LEX‑E02 (Metaphor hygiene).** If a metaphor is used, show the pattern that defines it; otherwise rename.
**RSCR‑LEX‑E03 (Strategy token minting).** Reject new Kernel tokens named **Strategy**/**Policy** as kinds; model them as **lenses/flows/compositions** inside **G.5** or as **…Description/…Spec** in Contexts. (Prevents kernel overloading; aligns with C.22 “no minted Strategy head”.)

## 8 · Morphology & Lexical Form (LEX.Morph)

> **Principle.** Form follows **object‑of‑talk**. A token’s morphology (suffix/prefix/casing) must (a) express **what kind of thing** it names, (b) respect **MG·DA** (Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring), and (c) pass **LEX.TokenClass** gates:
> `LEX.TokenClass(token) ∈ {KernelToken | ContextToken | DiscriminatorToken}`.
> Morphological choices never override **I/D/S layers** or **CHR\:ReferencePlane** semantics.

### 8.0 Casing & basic forms

**M‑0 (Casing and categories).**
Types & role kinds: **UpperCamelCase** (`IncisionOperatorRole`, `MethodDescription`).
Relations/verbs: **lowerCamelCase** (`performedBy`, `isExecutionOf`, `bindsMethod`).
IDs/instances: **flat with delimiters** (context‑defined) but never collide with type forms (e.g., `W#Seam134`, `ctx:Hospital.OR_2025`).
**Register discipline:** normative tokens use the Technical register; Plain synonyms are allowed in prose only, never in constraints.

### 8.1 Reserved suffixes (gated by LEX.TokenClass and I/D/S)

> **Use tables as a whitelist.** Rows indicate **when** a suffix is permitted and **what it means**. “Layer gate” prevents I/D/S confusion; “Examples” are illustrative.

| **Suffix**              | **Kind named** (object‑of‑talk)            | **Layer gate**                       | **LEX.TokenClass gate**         | **Examples**                                      | **Forbidden misuses (typical)**                                       |

| **`WorkPlan`**          | **Schedule of intent**                     | D‑layer (plan artefact)              | ContextToken                    | `MaintenanceWorkPlan_Q3`                          | Logging actuals; claiming execution.                                  |
| **`Service`**           | **External promise object**                | I‑layer (Standarded intension)       | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `ObjectStorageService`, `PassportIssuanceService` | Naming teams/APIs as “Service”.                                       |

| **`Observation`**       | **Observation record/kind**                | (run artefact; not I/D/S)            | ContextToken/DiscriminatorToken | `VibrationObservation`                            | Mixing with `MethodDescription` or `Evaluation`.                      |
| **`Evaluation`**        | **Evaluation artefact**                    | D/S‑layer (epistemic episteme)              | ContextToken/DiscriminatorToken | `CalibrationEvaluation`                           | Using to name roles or methods.                                       |
| **`EvidenceRole`**      | **Role in evidence assembly**              | I‑layer (role kind)                  | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `WitnessStatementEvidenceRole`                    | Using as a generic “evidence”.                                        |

| **`System`/`Holon`**    | **Substantial entity**                     | I‑layer                              | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `AnesthesiaSystem`, `OrderFulfillmentHolon`       | Using to denote Context or run artefact.                              |
| **`Boundary`**          | **System boundary**                        | I‑layer                              | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `SterileFieldBoundary`                            | Using as a role or method.                                            |
| **`Objective`**         | **Target state**                           | I/D‑layer (depends on formalization) | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `HemostasisObjective`                             | Encoding acceptance tests here (put tests in Spec/MethodDescription). |
| **`Requirement`**       | **Obligation at acceptance**               | D/S‑layer                            | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `LatencyRequirement`                              | Using as a role or capability.                                        |
| **`BoundedContext`**    | **Context card**                           | (meta‑structural; not I/D/S)         | ContextToken                    | `ITIL_2020_BoundedContext`                        | Treating Context as domain; minting `U.*` inside a Context.           |
| **`Surface`**              | Publication/Interop surface (episteme)   | D/S-layer (publication)     | ContextToken                     | PublicationSurface, InteropSurface       | StructureSurface, MechanismSurface, PortfolioSurface |
| **`Card`**                 | UTS/record unit (episteme)               | D-layer (publication)       | ContextToken                     | MethodCard, ExternalIndexCard            | Encoding runtime actuals; using as a ‘Service’  |
 
| **Suffix** | **Lexical class** | **Meaning / Ontology** | **Where it lives** | **Examples / Notes** |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| **Space** | Intensional kind | A typed **state space** (finite product of Characteristic×Scale slots); no procedures | Kernel A.19; CHR/space consumers | `CharacteristicSpace`, `CreativitySpace`. Edition of a Space is a **phase** of the episteme that defines it. |
| **SpaceRef** | Pointer | Registry reference to a Space | Data fields / UTS | `CharacteristicSpaceRef`. Use **`.edition`** on the **Ref** when pinning a historical phase. |
| **Map** | Intensional kind (method) | A **mapping method** from subjects to coordinates in a declared Space (encoder/featurizer) | Kernel/Method family (I‑layer), described/spec’d via I/D/S | `DescriptorMap` (declares invariances, corpus typing). Not a record or file. |
| **MapRef** | Pointer | Registry reference to a **Map** | Data fields / UTS | `DescriptorMapRef`. Pin the method phase via **`DescriptorMapRef.edition`**. |
| **Def** | S‑layer alias (CG‑Spec family) | A **definition/specification artifact** that fixes a **formula** or **distance** over a space; *synonym of …Spec* **within CG‑Spec registries only** | Part G (CG‑Spec family) | `DistanceDef` ≍ `DistanceSpec`. Prefer **…Spec** in new normative prose; **…Def** retained where already published. |
| **DefRef** | Pointer | Registry reference to a **…Spec/…Def** | Data fields / UTS | `DistanceDefRef`. Use **`DistanceDefRef.edition`** to pin the exact formula edition. |
| **Spec** | S‑layer | Testable invariants bound to acceptance harness (per E.10.D2) | S‑layer, Spec‑gated | Use for normative calculi and gauges. |
| **Slot** | Structural position | Named **argument position** in a relation/morphism signature (SlotKind in A.6.5) | Kernel A.6.0/A.6.5 | `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`. Always names a *position*; never used for ValueKinds or episteme fields. |
| **Ref** | Pointer | **Reference/identifier** to a registry item of some ValueKind (RefKind in A.6.5), not the thing itself | Data fields / UTS; RefKind types | `U.EntityRef`, `U.HolonRef`; episteme fields `…Ref : U.EntityRef`. Reserved for **RefKinds** and episteme fields typed as them; `…Ref` **never** carries content and is never used for ValueKinds or SlotKinds. |
| **Series** | Governance object | A **PhaseOf chain** (“editions”) for an episteme | Edition governance | `U.EditionSeries`. Holds immutability and provenance rules. |
| **.edition** | Attribute (on **Ref**) | The **phase id** of the **referenced artifact**; attaches to `…Ref`, not to the artifact’s name | Data fields / UTS | Use `XRef.edition`, **not** bare `XEdition` fields. Lower camelCase for keys. |

**Notes.**
• **Kernel‑only ban list** remains in § 8.3.
• **CHR guard:** the only token that may use the word *plane* is **CHR:ReferencePlane**.
• **Axis/dimension metaphors** are deprecated; use **Characteristic / CharacteristicSpace** where an enumeration is intended (see § 7).

**Not only suffix guard**
* Suffixes are strongly related to kinds and **should** be clearly guarded by MG·DA.
* Other morphemes (not only suffixes) also **must** respect kinds. For example, **Space is a geometric concept** — **never** use it as a suffix (`…Space…`) or other morpheme in beginning or in the middle of a term to name non‑geometric entities (e.g. prefer **Set/Kid/Kit** instead of **Space** where membership is intended).

**L‑SURF — disciplined use of *Surface* **
* ***Definition.** *Surface* is reserved for **publication/interoperability surfaces** (UTS, shipping, interop) that present lawful, plane‑aware summaries for human/selector consumption. A **Surface is a bundle of views** (ISO 42010 sense) packaged for a stated **audience** and **purpose**, with declared **viewpoint**. Surfaces are **conceptual** (E.5.2); serialisations live in Annex/Interop. Surfaces package **D/S** projections produced via `Describe_ID` / `Specify_DS` (A.7) and do **not** change object ontology.
* ***Allowed:** `PublicationSurface`, `InteropSurface` (G.10/G.13).  
* ***Forbidden:** `StructureSurface`, `MechanismSurface`, any `…Surface` that denotes a structural, mechanistic or measurement object.  
* ***Preferred alternatives:** use `…Boundary` (structural border), `…View` (publication view), or `…Card` (UTS record).

**L‑SPACE — disciplined use of *Space* **
* Use *Space* only for **CHR‑grounded measurement/state constructs** (e.g., `CharacteristicSpace` per A.19). Do **not** coin generic `…Space` for sets/portfolios or publication artefacts. Publish portfolios/archives as **sets** via lawful selectors; surface them on UTS as **views/cards**, not as spaces. 
* **Field‑name guard (Kernel blocks).** In **Kernel conceptual blocks** (e.g., A.6.0/A.6.1 lists), **do not** name a field `…Space`; reserve *Space* to the **types** (CHR/ReferencePlane families). Use **BaseType** as the field name and let the referenced `U.Type` carry `…Space` where appropriate; otherwise, for set‑valued universes, use `…Set`.
* Space is geomertic concept, neve use it even not as a suffix for naming non-geometric spaces (e.g. instead of Sets with membership)

**L‑ROLE — disciplined use of *Role***
* **Role** is always **Role Enactment for the `U.Holon`/`U.System` kind** (agentive use).
* **Param‑slot / relation‑endpoint guard.** Do **not** use the morpheme **`Role`** for **formal parameter positions** in operator algebra declarations (`OperatorAlgebra`) or Signature arguments. Reserve **`Role`** for **agentive kinds** only (A.2/F.4/F.6). Use a **`ParamKinds`** list (name→Kind) or `RelationEndpointKinds` to type formal slots. Same for similar situations (table columns, tuple placements): use MG·DA with domain‑**specific** terminology, never “Role”. 

### 8.2 Forbidden suffixes & the DevOps and Data Governance Lexical Firewall

**M‑F (Forbidden in Kernel tokens).** In KernelToken names, do **not** use: *…Function*, *…Process*, *…Task*, *…Activity*. These are ambiguous or vacuous—map using § 6 typing rules (often to `Method`, `MethodDescription`, or `Work`).

**M‑FW (Tool/file markers).** Tooling/file suffixes (*…API*, *…JSON*, *…YAML*, *…CI*, *…Kafka*, *…Postgres*) are **not** part of conceptual names. Place them in **Context** glossaries or operational configs (DevOps Lexical Firewall). Kernel names never carry tool/format/notation marks. It is pure conceptual, no data management and data governance intended.

### 8.3 Prefix discipline

**M‑P1 (Reserved prefixes).** `U.` reserved for **Kernel types**; `Γ_` for algebraic operators; `CAL/LOG/CHR` for **architheory packages**. Never mint `U.*` inside a Context.

**M‑P2 (Edition markers).** Apply explicit edition/version markers to **Contexts** and to `MethodDescription` / `Service`—**not** to `Method` (e.g., `BPMN_2.0_BoundedContext`, `JS_Schedule_v4_MethodDescription`, `PassportIssuanceService_v2025`).  Authors MAY annotate Context or Service names for didactics.
**Norms (edition vs release vs version).**
1) **edition** — the **content phase** of an episteme (Concept/Object/Symbol where Symbol‑only notation swaps do not force a phase). Lives in `U.EditionSeries`. Never embedded in labels (see R‑RD‑7); bind via data: `…Ref.edition`. 
2) **release** — a **Work** of making a **Carrier** public; may carry tags/dates; does **not** change episteme identity or phase.
3) **version** — a **tooling/carrier** identifier (file/package/code). Use only in Tooling/Pedagogy families; not in Core names.

**Property discipline.** When a field pins a referenced artifact’s phase, write it as **`<Thing>Ref.edition`** (dot notation), never as a standalone `…Edition` key. E.g., replace `DHCMethodEdition` with `DHCMethodRef.edition`.

### 8.4 Morphology tests (apply with § 7 MG·DA)

**M‑1 (Slot test).** The candidate fits **one** slot in the Strict Distinction lattice (Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier; Role ≠ Method ≠ Work). If not, **rename** or split.

**M‑2 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring).** The head noun names the **object being classified** (Role/Method/Service/Work/Context/Characteristic). No free‑floating metaphors.

**M‑3 (Family congruence).** Where eligibility clarity is needed, add a **Context‑specific characteristic** (RCS) as a qualifier (e.g., `NormativeStandardRole`). Do **not** fake families with bare metaphors (no `RowPlane`, `senseFamily`, `…Lane`).

**M‑4 (Run vs design).** Use **`Work`** only for executions; use **`MethodDescription`** for recipes; never cross.

**M‑5 (Kernel parochiality).** KernelToken names carry **no domain nouns**; push domain markers to Context or RCS.

**M‑6 (Vacuity ban).** Avoid vacuous heads (*Thing, Event, Process, Resource*). Use established kernel heads (`U.Holon`, `U.Work`, `U.Method`, `U.Resrc`, …).

**M‑7 (Notation independence).** Intensional meaning survives notation/tool swaps.

**M‑8 (Collision & uniqueness).** Before merge, run **full‑text** + **Reserved‑Names** checks; the token must not collide with any other meaning anywhere in FPF (cf. § 7 MG·DA‑T5).

### 8.5 Alias hygiene

Aliases live **only** inside a **Context Glossary** and map to **one** technical label with an **equivalence** note (≡). No global aliases.

### 8.6 Compatibility with USM (acts vs tokens)

**LEX applies to tokens; USM applies to acts.** Mint/rename/use are **LexicalActs** that carry a USM scope (e.g., ClaimScope, WorkScope). LEX constrains **where** a token form may appear via **AllowedScopes** policies:

`LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)`.

Example: using a `KernelToken` in a Context constraint may require a Bridge/alias; logging `Work` inside a MethodDescription violates M‑4 and the policy.

### 8.7 Acceptance & regression checks (LEX/USM)

* **SCR‑MOR‑S01 (Suffix whitelist).** Every normative token with a reserved suffix matches § 8.1 row semantics and passes Layer gates.
* **SCR‑MOR‑S02 (Kernel bans).** KernelToken names contain none of the forbidden suffixes (§ 8.2).
* **SCR‑MOR‑S03 (Prefixes).** Reserved prefixes obey § 8.3; no `U.*` minted in Context.
* **SCR‑MOR‑S04 (Run/design gate).** `Work` appears only for executions; `MethodDescription` has no runtime actuals.
* **SCR‑MOR‑S05 (Collision).** Full‑text + Reserved‑Names checks pass (no other sense of the token elsewhere).
* **SCR‑MOR‑S06 (Object‑of‑talk).** Heads pass M‑2; no bare metaphors as heads.
* **RSCR‑MOR‑E01 (DevOps firewall).** Tool/file suffixes quarantined to Context; none leak into KernelToken names.
* **RSCR‑MOR‑E02 (USM compliance).** For each LexicalAct, verify `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)` (see § 7.5).

### 8.8 Autonomy lexicon (L‑AUTO )
**Forbidden (Core):** bare “validity”, “actor/agent” (as free‑standing nouns), “kill switch”, “process” for behavior, “envelope” when used **as scope**.
**Use instead:** *Scope (G)* for epistemic scope; *WorkScope* for capability bounds; *RoleAssignment* for who acts; *SpeechAct* for overrides; *SafeStop* instead of “kill switch”.
**Named prefixes (policy & registry):**
* `aut:` for AutonomyBudgetDecl fields (e.g., `aut:action_tokens`, `aut:risk_bands`);
* `guard:` for guard checks bound to `AdmissibilityConditionsId`;
* `ovr:` for override SpeechActs (`ovr:PauseAutonomy`, `ovr:ResumeAutonomy`, …).

**Notes.**
1) Scope‑sensitive guards **must** declare the **Γ_time** window selector used for admission checks.
2) Proper names of patterns/components that already include “Agent/Agency” (e.g., *Agency‑CHR*, *Agent‑Tools‑CAL*) are permitted as **titled terms**; avoid re‑introducing “agent” as a free‑standing noun in new prose.

### 8.9 · LEX-CHR-STRICT — Reserve *Characteristic* for CSLC-measurable aspects

**Intent.** Prevent calling **non-measurable** objects (sets, statuses, scopes, policies, bridges, contexts, guards) “characteristics”.

**Rule L-CHR-S1 (Reservation).** Use **Characteristic** **only** for variables that **declare a CSLC scale** (nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio) with admissible values/units/polarity (Part C.16/A.17–A.18).  
**Rule L-CHR-S2 (USM).** `U.Scope` / `U.ClaimScope (G)` / `U.WorkScope` are **USM scope objects**, not Characteristics; they **must not** appear in any `CharacteristicSpace`.  
**Rule L-CHR-S3 (Status).** ESG/RSG statuses and deоntic/epistemic statuses — **not Characteristics**; its statuses/states.  
**Rule L-CHR-S4 (Lexical classifiers).** Lexical classifiers/tags — **Facets**/**attributes**; do not name them as Characteristics, if not declared **CSLC**.
**Checks.**  
— **CC-L-CHR-1.** `scope characteristic(s)` is banned in Core/Context.  
— **CC-L-CHR-2.** `CharacteristicSpace` near `Scope` — error.  
— **CC-L-CHR-3.** Canonical rewrite: `F–G–R characteristics` → `F–G–R components`.

### 8.10 LEX‑QA‑1 — Using “‑ility/‑ilities” terms (availability, reliability, …)

**Rule.** Tokens ending with **‑ility/‑ilities** or widely used quality names (**Availability, Reliability, Security, Safety, Scalability, Maintainability, Usability**, …) are **Quality‑Family labels**, not automatically CHR **Characteristics**.  

**Authoring choice:**  
— To use such a term as a **CHR** characteristic (axis), **bind** it to a **named `U.Characteristic` with one CSLC Scale** (A.18) and refer to that Characteristic in guards/UTS;  
— Otherwise **publish a Q‑Bundle** (see **C.25**) that includes **Measures (CHR)** (the measurable slots) and, where relevant, **Scope** (USM set over `U.ContextSlice`) and windows/mechanism/status fields.  

**Rationale.** Scope is **set‑valued** (USM) and **not** a CHR measurement; mechanisms/statuses are governance artefacts. Keeping them outside the CHR CSLC avoids illegal scalarisation and preserves set‑algebra semantics for scope.  (A.2.6 § 6.2; A.6.1; C.16/A.18). 


## 9 · Canonical rewrites for overloaded words (LEX L‑rules; normative)

> **What this section does.** LEX L‑rules standardise **how we speak** in Core/Context by mapping overloaded everyday words to **canonical FPF concepts**.
> **What this section does not do.** It does **not** restate naming (see **§ 7 MG·DA**) or morphology/casing/suffix rules (see **§ 8 LEX.Morph**); it **depends** on them.
> **Guards.** Tokens are classified by **`LEX.TokenClass ∈ {KernelToken, ContextToken, DiscriminatorToken}`** (§ 7.1). Only **CHR:ReferencePlane** may use the bare word *plane*; I/D/S are **layers**; enumerations are **Characteristics** in a **CharacteristicSpace** **only when a CSLC scale is declared; otherwise treat such slots as non-measurable attributes (not Characteristics)**.

### 9.1 Hard bans and canonical rewrites (single table; normative)

> **Use this table mechanically.** “Ban” means the weak phrase is **not allowed** in Core prose/identifiers/diagrams unless the **canonical** appears alongside it (or as a registered Context alias). “Layer/Token gates” prevent I/D/S and TokenClass leaks (cf. § 8.1).

### 9.2 Quick, lintable substitutions (mechanical helpers)

> Editors may auto‑offer these rewrites; accept only if the transformed sentence passes **§ 7 MG·DA** and **§ 8 LEX.Morph** gates.

### 9.3 Acceptance tests (LEX‑AC)

A text **passes** LEX if all answers are **Green**:

1. **Context named.** Polysemous terms appear **inside a named `U.BoundedContext`** (or the page declares a local context card).
2. **Right layer.** I/D/S layer respected: types/roles on I; recipes/docs on D; actuals on runs (cf. § 8.1 gates).
3. **Promise vs ability vs performance.** `Service` (promise), `Capability` (ability), `Work` (performance) are not conflated.
4. **No anthropomorphism.** Documents/datasets/models do not “do”; **Systems** do.
5. **Scheduling hygiene.** No actuals on `WorkPlan`; all actuals live on `Work`.
6. **Cross‑context reuse.** Any reuse across Contexts cites a **Bridge id** with CL & loss notes.
7. **MG·DA ok.** New or refactored tokens pass **§ 7 MG·DA** (anchored head noun; collision check; CharacteristicSpace for enums).
8. **Morphology ok.** Suffix/prefix/casing respect **§ 8 LEX.Morph** (e.g., `…Role`, `MethodDescription`, `Work`, reserved prefixes).
9. **Banned tokens absent.** No *process/function/task/activity* in Kernel senses; no tooling/file suffixes in Kernel tokens.
10. **State gating present (when needed).** Readiness is expressed via **RSG state** + **StateAssertion**, not vague “approved/ready”.

### 9.4 Coordination map (how LEX plugs into the rest of FPF)

* **With E.10.D1 D.CTX (Context discipline).**
  ULR–CTX‑1: Every Core meaning that can vary **names its `U.BoundedContext`**.
  ULR–CTX‑2: Same‑spelled labels are **distinct senses** across Contexts; reuse requires a **Bridge** (F.9) with CL & loss notes.

* **With E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline).**
  Speak in the **right I/D/S layer**. ULR–IDS‑1..3 apply (types/roles = I; descriptions/specs = D/S; work/state assertions = evaluations/occurrences). Upgrades D→S only when **checkable acceptance** exists.

* **With A.2 / A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment).**
  Role = **assignment**; Method = **way‑of‑doing**; MethodDescription = **documented recipe**; Work = **dated occurrence**. Sentences must keep this split.

* **With F‑cluster (Unification) & UTS (F.17).**
  Harvest in one Context → **SenseCell** → **Concept‑Set row** with relation (`≡/⋈/⊂/⟂`) and losses. UTS is the human‑readable roll‑up.

> **Acts vs tokens.** LEX applies to **tokens**; USM applies to **acts** (mint/rename/use). Conformance: `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c ⇒ USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)` (see § 7.5).

---

### 9.5 Conformance checklist (LEX‑CC)

1. **LEX‑CC‑1 (Bans).** Any banned token in Core/Arch fails unless the **canonical** appears (or the token is a registered Context alias).
2. **LEX‑CC‑2 (Context).** Each polysemous term names its **`U.BoundedContext`**.
3. **LEX‑CC‑3 (Layer/Morph).** Usage passes **§ 8** gates (suffix/prefix/casing) and I/D/S layer checks.
4. **LEX‑CC‑4 (Bridge).** Cross‑context reuse cites **Bridge id** and CL; same‑spelled labels without a Bridge are non‑conformant.
5. **LEX‑CC‑5 (MG·DA).** New tokens pass **MG·DA** tests, including **full‑text collision** and **Reserved‑Names** checks.
6. **LEX‑CC‑6 (Service & evidence).** Service acceptance computed from **Work**; evidence is an **EvidenceRole** on an **Episteme** with provenance.
7. **LEX‑CC‑7 (USM compatibility).** For each LexicalAct, `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)`.

**Editorial note.**
This section **inherits** § 7 **MG·DA** (anchored head nouns; Characteristic/CharacteristicSpace for enums; collision checks) and § 8 **LEX.Morph** (suffix/prefix/casing). It deliberately **omits** their details to avoid duplication.  The only legitimate uses of *plane* in the Core are **CHR:ReferencePlane** and the derived operators **CL^plane** and **Φ_plane**; policy flags MUST NOT introduce new “planes”. To distinguish pre‑operational vs operational states *within* **ReferencePlane=world**, use **WorldRegime ∈ {prep|live}** (formerly `PlaneRegime`).

## 10 · Migration playbook — turning messy language into ULR‑clean prose *(informative)*

> A pragmatic **three‑pass** routine. Works with plain text, diagrams, or models; no tools required.

### Pass 0 — *Pre‑flight (2 minutes per page)*

0.1 **Name the Context card** you’re writing in (title, edition, scope note).
0.2 For every new or renamed token, **declare `LEX.TokenClass`** ∈ {KernelToken, ContextToken, DiscriminatorToken}.
0.3 Run **MG·DA pre‑check** (anchored head noun; no metaphor heads; if enum → declare its **CharacteristicSpace**).
0.4 Run **collision/uniqueness**: full‑text grep + Reserved‑Names registry (see § 7). If collides → rename or DRR deprecate.

### Pass 1 — *Harvest in the Context*

1.1 **Underline overloaded words** (*process, service, function, workflow, ticket, approval, spec, plan,* …).
1.2 For each, write a **one‑line intent** in Plain register (what object‑of‑talk is meant).
1.3 Mark any cross‑Context reuse candidates.

### Pass 2 — *Map to Core anchors (mechanical)*

2.1 Replace underlined words via **§ 9 L‑rules** table:
 • recipe → **`U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription`**
 • scheduled run → **`U.Work` / `U.WorkPlan`**
 • promise → **`U.Service`**
 • ability → **`U.Capability`**
 • actor‑mask → **`…Role / RoleAssignment`**
 • document/evidence carrier → **`Episteme`** with **`EvidenceRole/RequirementRole`**
2.2 Apply **LEX.Morph** (§ 8): suffix gates (`…Role/…Work/MethodDescription/Service`), casing, reserved prefixes.
2.3 Pass **I/D/S layer** check: types/roles on I; recipes/docs on D; actuals on runs.
2.4 Attach **Context tags** on first use; set **twin labels** (Tech/Plain) in the local Glossary.

### Pass 3 — *Stitch & publish*

3.1 Add **safe rewrites** for any anti‑patterns you found (use § 9.2 quick table).
3.2 If sameness is needed across Contexts, create a **Bridge** (F.9) with relation kind, **CL**, and loss notes.
3.3 Publish a one‑page **UTS** (F.17) for the Context (columns: Context, Tech label, Plain label, Kernel anchor, Warnings).
3.4 Log a short **DRR** when renames/aliases occur (F.13), linking to grep results that motivated the change.

---

## 11 · ULR conformance prompts *(normative, concept‑only questions)*

> Use these **prompts** during review. They reference § 7 (MG·DA) and § 8 (LEX.Morph) instead of repeating them.

1. **Context prompt.** Does each potentially polysemous noun live inside a **named `U.BoundedContext`**?
2. **Layer prompt.** Is each sentence in the correct **I/D/S layer** (I: type/role; D: description/spec; run: actuals)?
3. **Token prompt.** For new/renamed tokens, is **`LEX.TokenClass`** declared and consistent with where the token appears?
4. **Object‑of‑talk prompt.** Does the **head noun** name the object being classified (Role/Method/Service/Work/Context/Characteristic)?
5. **Morphology prompt.** Do suffix/prefix/casing pass **LEX.Morph** gates (e.g., `…Role`, `MethodDescription`, `Work`)?
6. **Promise vs ability vs performance.** Are **Service** (promise), **Capability** (ability), and **Work** (performance) distinct?
7. **Plan vs execution.** Are **WorkPlan** windows separated from **Work** actuals?
8. **Evidence prompt.** Do documents **hold roles** and **justify**, while **systems act**?
9. **Bridge prompt.** If sameness spans Contexts, is there an explicit **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
10. **Collision prompt.** Did we run full‑text + Reserved‑Names checks (no other meaning of this token anywhere in FPF)?

---

## 12 · ULR regression cues *(concept‑only “diff” triggers)*

Re‑review your prose when any of these happen:

* **Context edition** changes → re‑affirm twin labels, Bridges, and acceptance wording.
* **A role/type name grows** (“and/plus/‑‑”) → apply MG·DA: split or bundle (A.2).
* **A “service” statement broadens scope** → check that **acceptance** terms cover the new target; else split the Service.
* **Recipes gain/lose steps** → update **`MethodDescription`**, not `Service` or `Role` names.
* **Evidence verbs creep into actor sentences** → re‑apply L‑rules (documents don’t act).
* **New token minted** → ensure `LEX.TokenClass` declared; run collision checks; add CharacteristicSpace if enum.
* **Suffix drift** (e.g., `…Work` on a plan) → fix via **LEX.Morph**.
* **Cross‑Context reuse by label** appears → require a **Bridge** (F.9) or split senses.

---

## 13 · Teaching deck — the ULR quick card *(reusable in any Context)*

> **Say it cleanly, once (memorise):**
> **Role** = assignment (mask) · **Method** = way‑of‑doing · **MethodDescription** = recipe (document) · **Work** = run (dated)
> **Capability** = can‑do within bounds (envelope + measures) · **Service** = promise (access + acceptance)
> **I/D/S are layers**; **documents don’t act**; **Contexts own meanings**; **Bridges** move meanings.

**Name forms (allowed morphology):**
• **Types/roles:** `<Noun><Role/Type>` (`IncidentCommanderRole`, `NormativeStandardRole`, `WorkItemType`).
• **Statuses:** `<Noun>Status` inside the Context’s role space (`ApprovedStatus`) — status‑only; not enactable.
• **No suitcase nouns:** avoid “and/plus/&” in names; use **bundles** (A.2) or separate roles.
• **Acronyms:** first expansion + register; short‑form registered per **§ 7.7**.

## 14 · Three worked micro‑examples — ULR across domains *(informative)*

### 14.1 Healthcare (OR context)

**Messy:** “The surgical **process** is scheduled at 08:00; the SOP approves the incision and the **service** documents recovery.”
**ULR rewrite:**
“**WorkPlan** OR‑Case‑221 starts 08:00 and will execute **MethodDescription** `Incision_v4`.
`SOP_OR_v4` holds **RequirementRole**; a **SpeechAct Work** by `QA_Officer#ApproverRole` authorises the run.
The hospital offers **Service** ‘Post‑op monitoring’ (access = ward protocol; acceptance = vitals envelope).”

### 14.2 Manufacturing (assembly line)

**Messy:** “The welding **function** provides air‑tight seams; the **process** costs 3 min.”
**ULR rewrite:**
“`Robot_SN789` has **Capability** ‘execute `Weld_MIG_v3` within envelope E at measures M’.
**Work** instances that **fulfil Service** ‘Provide seam S’ average 3 min; **acceptance** bounds are in `Seal_Acceptance.md`.
The **MethodDescription** is `Weld_MIG_v3`; the **Role** is `WelderRole`.”

### 14.3 Cloud/SRE (production Context)

**Messy:** “The storage **service** wrote logs and the deployment **process** failed after 2 min.”
**ULR rewrite:**
“`sCG‑Spec_ci_bot#DeployerRole:CD_v7` performed **Work** ‘Deploy r4711’ (failed at T+120 s).
The platform offers **Service** ‘Object Storage’ (access = `S3_API_Spec_vX`; **acceptance** = durability/availability targets).
`LogWriter` is a **System** bearing `TransformerRole` that wrote the records; *the service did not act*.”

---

## 15 · Closing notes *(governance & purity)*

* **Notation‑agnostic.** ULR is a **language constitution**, not a scanner or template. Apply it in prose, sketches, or formal models.
* **Where checks live.** Convenience checks belong to Tooling; ULR itself stays notation‑agnostic. Conformance code lives in **SCR‑LEX / RSCR‑LEX** as referenced above.
* **Acts vs tokens.** LEX applies to **tokens**; USM applies to **acts** (mint/rename/use). Conformance:
  `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)` (§ 7.5).
* **Guards honoured.** DevOps Lexical Firewall and Unidirectional Dependency remain intact.
* **Reserved “plane”.** Only **`CHR:ReferencePlane`** uses the bare word *plane*; I/D/S are **layers**; all other category talk is expressed as **Characteristics** in a **CharacteristicSpace**.

> **One‑line memory:** *“ULR keeps words honest so ideas stay composable.”*

  
# E.10.P — **Conceptual Prefixes (policy & registry)**  \[A]
 **Intent.** Provide a compact, **notation‑neutral** registry and **minting policy** for *conceptual prefixes* — short shorthands that signal **cognitive namespaces** used throughout the Core.

 **Policy (normative).**
1. **Purpose.** A conceptual prefix exists **to aid reasoning**, not to name files, serialisations, or APIs. It labels a **role in thought** (e.g., meta‑type, calculus operator, relation family).
 2. **Anchoring.** Every prefix **MUST** be anchored to a **Core architheory**  (CAL/LOG/CHR) or Kernel construct and documented in its *Relations*.
 3. **No tool lock‑in.** A prefix **MUST NOT** imply a particular notation or machine binding (see E.5.1–E.5.2).
 4. **Minting rule.** New prefixes are introduced by a **DRR** (E.9) that demonstrates
    (a) cross‑architheory need, 
    (b) non‑overlap with existing prefixes,
    (c) alignment with Pillars **P‑1/P‑5**.
 5. **Scope.** Prefixes are **globally reserved** within the Core; domain plugins  **MAY** mint local shorthands only inside their Contexts and **MUST NOT** collide with this registry.

 **Registered conceptual prefixes (Core).**
* `U.` — **U.Types meta‑namespace** (holons & primitives). *Anchor:* Kernel Part A.
* `Γ_` — **Calculus operator family** (by flavour: `Γ_sys`, `Γ_epist`, …). *Anchor:* Part B umbrella on Γ.
* `ut:` — **Universal relation family** (e.g., `PartOf` sub‑relations). *Anchor:* A.14 (Mereology) — informative alias vocabulary.
* `tv:` — **Trace & Validation vocabulary** (CT2R‑LOG): `tv:AliasOf`, `tv:groundedBy`. *Anchor:* B.3 (Trust & Assurance, LOG‑use). 
* `ev:` — **Evidence hooks** (bindings/roles). *Anchor:* A.10 / B.3 (Evidence Graph Referring).
* `mero:` — **Mereology trace types** (internal labels: `SumTrace` / `SetTrace` / `SliceTrace`) used **informatively** in examples. *Anchor:* B.1 (Γ‑aggregation).

**Conformance Checklist (E.10.P).**
* **CC‑LEX‑P.1** New Core text **SHALL NOT** introduce an unregistered conceptual prefix.
* **CC‑LEX‑P.2** Each occurrence of a registered prefix **SHALL** cite its anchor pattern on first use in a section.
* **CC‑LEX‑P.3** Examples that expand a prefix into a concrete URI or syntax **MUST** mark the expansion *informative* and locate it in Tooling/Pedagogy.

**Relations.** Constrains E.5.1 (Lexical Firewall) & E.5.2 (Notational Independence); Depends on E.9 (DRR).
  
# E.10.D1 — Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX) \[D]

> **One‑sentence summary.** Make the word **Context** unambiguous: in FPF it **only** denotes the formal primitive **`U.BoundedContext`**; remove the term **anchor**; reserve **Problem Frame** for situational narrative; treat **Domain** as an **informative family label**, not a type.

**Status.** Discipline \[D], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** C‑6 *Strict Distinction*; C‑7 *Temporal Duality*; G‑1 *Minimal Generality*; G‑2 *Contextual Specification*.
**Coordinates with.** E.10.U1 *Domain‑Family Landscape Survey*; E.10.U2 *Term Harvesting & Normalisation*; E.10.U7 *Concept‑Set Table*; E.10.U9 *Alignment/Bridge*; `RoleAssigning` patterns (e.g., E.10.U4).
**Aliases (informative).** Context Discipline; No‑Anchor Rule.

---

## 1 · Intent & Applicability

**Intent.** Eliminate ambiguity around “context” by (a) fixing **one** formal meaning—`U.BoundedContext`; (b) removing “anchor” from the vocabulary; (c) reserving **Problem Frame** for prose about situations; and (d) clarifying **Domain** as an **informative family** (workflow, provenance, services, …) that groups several `U.BoundedContext`s.

**Applicability.** Mandatory across **all architheories** (Role Assignment & Enactment, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, planned LCA-CAL). Apply at the start of any unification effort and whenever documentation introduces or refactors “context”, “domain”, “anchor”.

**Non‑goals.** No governance, workflow, or tool mandates; no storage formats; no team roles.

---

## 2 · Problem Frame

1. **Polysemy.** “Context” is used for formal scopes, narrative situations, and even runtime modes.
2. **Extra token (“anchor”).** “Anchor” pretends to be “where meaning is attached”, duplicating context semantics.
3. **Domain overreach.** “Domain context” conflates **families** (disciplinary areas) with **formal contexts**.
4. **Plane mixing.** Runtime/design stances and deontic/behavioural notions are smuggled into “context”.

## 4 · Solution — **Name one thing “Context” can mean**

**D‑CTX‑1 (Canonical meaning).** In all FPF materials, **Context** denotes the formal primitive **`U.BoundedContext`** only. The short form **Context** is permitted in the *Tech* register strictly as an alias of `U.BoundedContext`.

**D‑CTX‑2 (Remove “anchor”).** The term **anchor** is **prohibited**. When you need “the place where a meaning lives”, use:

* **`SenseCell := (U.BoundedContext, Local‑Sense)`** — the *cell of meaning* inside a specific Context; or
* a **`ConceptSet.Row`** + column reference (see E.10.U7).

**D‑CTX‑3 (Domain is informative).** **Domain** (workflow, provenance, services, access, sensing, …) is **not** a U.Type. It is an **informative family label** grouping several `U.BoundedContext`s. There is no “domain context”.

**D‑CTX‑4 (Narrative is Problem Frame).** Use **Problem Frame** (or **Frame**) for situational narrative in patterns. Do **not** use “context” for narrative sections.

**D‑CTX‑5 (Time is a tag, not a context).** `design` / `run` are **TimeScope tags** (C‑7) on artefacts or sources; they do **not** create separate contexts.

**D‑CTX‑6 (No context inheritance).** `U.BoundedContext`s have **no is‑a** or containment relations. Any cross‑context relationship appears **only** via E.10.U9 *Alignment/Bridge* with explicit loss policies.

**D‑CTX‑7 (Language/edition discipline).** Different languages or editions may be **distinct `U.BoundedContext`s** when meaning or usage can diverge. Where an official source binds multilingual labels to the **same** semantics, record them as **labels** of the **same** Context.

**D‑CTX‑8 (Reference forms).** Use **one of the following** when pointing to meaning:

* **`ContextId:LocalLabel`** (e.g., `BPMN_2_0:process`), or
* **`SenseCell(ContextId, Local‑SenseId)`**, or
* **ConceptSet(RowId).Column(ContextId)** (E.10.U7).

---

## 5 · Structure — Minimal reference shapes (informative)

> Shapes shown **do not** prescribe formats; they are naming conventions.

* **Context Id.** Stable short handle (e.g., `BPMN_2_0`, `PROV_O_2013`, `ITIL4_2020`, `NIST_RBAC_2004`, `SOSA_SSN_2017`).
* **SenseCell.** `(ContextId, Local‑Sense)` where `Local‑Sense` is the Context‑local preferred label (from E.10.U2).
* **ConceptSet Row.** A table row keyed by a row id; columns are `SenseCell`s per Context (E.10.U7).

---

## 6 · Core Invariants (normative)

1. **LCTX‑INV‑1 (Uni‑meaning).** The word **Context** in formal text equals **`U.BoundedContext`**.
2. **LCTX‑INV‑2 (No anchor).** The token **anchor** does **not** appear in normative prose; use **SenseCell** or **ConceptSet reference**.
3. **LCTX‑INV‑3 (No domain contexts).** “Domain context” is invalid; use **Domain family** + list of `U.BoundedContext`s.
4. **LCTX‑INV‑4 (Frames, not contexts).** Pattern headers use **Problem Frame** for narrative.
5. **LCTX‑INV‑5 (No hierarchy).** Contexts are flat; relationships are declared **only** via E.10.U9 Bridges.
6. **LCTX‑INV‑6 (Plane hygiene).** Contexts describe **context of meaning** for sources; they are not roles, statuses, executions, or types (C‑6).
7. **LCTX‑INV‑7 (Time tags).** DesignRunTag is a **tag** on artefacts/sources; it does not multiply contexts.
8. **LCTX‑INV‑8 (Language/edition).** Multilingual or multi‑edition handling follows D‑CTX‑7.

---

## 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

* **CC‑LCTX‑1.** Grep‑style check: every “Context” in formal sections expands to **`U.BoundedContext`**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑2.** The token **anchor** is absent from normative text; where needed, occurrences are replaced by **SenseCell** or **ConceptSet reference**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑3.** Pattern headers use **Problem Frame**; none use “Context” for narrative.
* **CC‑LCTX‑4.** References to meaning are in one of the **reference forms** (Sec. 5).
* **CC‑LCTX‑5.** No file defines “domain context”; Domain appears only as an **informative family**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑6.** No is‑a edges between contexts; any cross‑context relation is located in **E.10.U9**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑7.** Language/edition handling matches **D‑CTX‑7** (separate Contexts when semantics can diverge).

| **A6 Cross‑lingual blending** | Mixing language labels as one context despite divergent semantics | Hidden drift                         | Split Contexts per **D‑CTX‑7** or document shared semantics if truly bound.  |

---

## 9 · Worked Examples (multi‑architheory)

**9.1 Enactment — process vs activity (two context of meaning).**

* Use `BPMN_2_0:process` and `PROV_O_2013:activity` as **SenseCell**s.
* In a Concept‑Set row, code the provisional relation `⋈` (overlap), not an equality.
* Role Descriptions later reference **the specific SenseCell**, not “an anchor”.

**9.2 Roles — behavioural mask vs access status.**

* `BPMN_2_0:participant` vs `NIST_RBAC_2004:role`.
* Mark `⟂` (incompatible) in the Concept‑Set row to prevent conflation.
* Any cross‑use requires E.10.U9 with explicit loss policy.

**9.3 Services & evidence.**

* `ITIL4_2020:service` / `ITIL4_2020:service‑level‑objective` with KD‑CAL cells `SOSA_SSN_2017:observation`.
* References in acceptance patterns point to **SenseCell**s; provenance stays within the PROV Context.

---

## 10 · Reasoning Primitives (conceptual judgements; notation‑agnostic)

> Pure **thinking moves**; no APIs, no storage, no governance.

* **(J1) Context expansion.** `⊢ Context ≡ U.BoundedContext`
  *Reading:* wherever “Context” appears in formal prose, it denotes `U.BoundedContext`.

* **(J2) Anchor ban.** `uses("anchor") ⊢ violation(D‑CTX‑2)`
  *Reading:* usage of “anchor” flags a discipline violation.

* **(J3) Sense reference.** `ref(ContextId, LocalLabel) ⊢ SenseCell(ContextId, Local‑Sense)`
  *Reading:* a well‑formed reference identifies a SenseCell.

* **(J4) Narrative frame.** `header("Context") ⊢ replaceWith("Problem Frame")`
  *Reading:* headings “Context” in patterns must become “Problem Frame”.

* **(J5) Domain family.** `label ∈ {workflow,…} ⊢ DomainFamily(label)`
  *Reading:* Domain labels are families, not contexts.

* **(J6) Time tag.** `stance ∈ {design, run} ⊢ TimeScopeTag(stance)`
  *Reading:* time is a tag, not a new context.

---

## 11 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:** C‑6, C‑7, G‑1, G‑2.
**Constrains:**

* **E.10.U1** — lists only `U.BoundedContext`s; no “domain contexts”; context records never encode architheory semantics.
* **E.10.U2** — Seeds and Occurrences are **always** Context‑anchored; references use forms from Sec. 5.
* **E.10.U7** — Columns are **SenseCell**s; row notes never call them “anchors”.
* **E.10.U9** — All cross‑context relations live here; no implicit equivalences elsewhere.
* **`RoleAssigning` patterns (E.10.U4, …)** — Context points to **SenseCell** or **Concept‑Set columns**, never to “anchors”.

---

## 12 · Migration Notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Rename headings.** Replace any “Context” section title with **Problem Frame**.
2. **Delete “anchor”.** Replace with **SenseCell** or **Concept‑Set** references.
3. **Split domain vs context.** Where “domain context” appears, rewrite as **Domain family** + explicit list of `U.BoundedContext`s.
4. **Audit references.** Ensure every semantic reference is `ContextId:LocalLabel` or `SenseCell(ContextId, …)` or Concept‑Set column.
5. **Flatten contexts.** Remove any inheritance among contexts; move relations to **E.10.U9**.
6. **Tag time.** Replace “design/runtime context” with **TimeScope tags**.
7. **Language/edition pass.** Split or merge Contexts per **D‑CTX‑7**; document rationale.

---

## 13 · Acceptance Tests (SCR/RSCR stubs)

**SCR — Static discipline checks**

* **SCR‑DCTX‑S01.** No occurrence of the token **anchor** in normative sections.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S02.** All formal uses of “Context” resolve to **`U.BoundedContext`**.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S03.** Pattern headers contain **Problem Frame** instead of “Context”.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S04.** All semantic references use the forms in Sec. 5.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S05.** No “domain context” strings; Domain appears only as family metadata.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S06.** No is‑a or containment relations between contexts outside **E.10.U9**.

**RSCR — Regression discipline checks**

* **RSCR‑DCTX‑E01.** Adding a new family or edition does not introduce “domain context” or context hierarchies.
* **RSCR‑DCTX‑E02.** Refactors of E.10.U1/U.2/U.7/U.9 do not re‑introduce “anchor”.
* **RSCR‑DCTX‑E03.** Multilingual updates follow D‑CTX‑7 (split/merge rationale recorded informatively).
  
## E.10.D2 — Intension–Description–Specification Discipline (I/D/S) \[D]

*Definitional pattern — normative, notation‑agnostic*

> **One‑sentence summary.** For every intensional FPF object (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.Service`), clearly distinguish the **thing itself** (*Intension*), its **context‑bound Description** (KU), and its **formal Specification** (KU). Use **–Spec** only when strict, testable invariants and an acceptance harness exist; otherwise use **–Description**. This keeps semantics clean, didactic, and testable across all architheories.

**Status.** Definitional [D], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** A.7 **Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)**; E.10.D1 **D.CTX (Context ≡ U.BoundedContext)**; C.2.1 **U.EpistemeSlotGraph (DescriptionContext, IDS‑13)**; C.2.3 **Unified Formality Characteristic (F)**.
**Coordinates with.** F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.10 **Evaluation**; F.15 **SCR/RSCR Harness**.
**Non‑goals.** No editors, workflows, registries, or storage formats. No tooling commitments.

### 1 · Problem frame

**Intent.** Prevent perennial confusions such as “the role contains the checklist” or “the method is the document.” Establish a universal discipline so that:

* **Intensions** (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`) remain I/D/S layer‑pure and context‑agnostic entities in the kernel.
* **Descriptions** (KUs) capture human‑readable, **Context‑local** semantics (labels, glosses, characterisations, state graphs, checklists).
* **Specifications** (KUs) exist **only** when there are verifiable invariants, an acceptance harness, **and a declared Formality F adequate for checkability (C.2.3; default F ≥ F4)**, making claims testable.

**Applicability.** Whenever an FPF text introduces or uses an intensional `U.Type` (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Service`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.RCS`, `U.RSG`, `U.RoleEnactment`) in any part (A–H).

### 2 · Problem 

1. **Plane/layer mixing.** Intensions are routinely conflated with their documents and with runtime facts.
2. **Name drift.** “Spec” gets used for any write‑up; “status” drifts between states of a role and epistemic/deontic statuses over knowledge units.
3. **Didactic friction.** Inconsistent naming raises cognitive load and impedes reuse across architheories.
4. **Unverifiable claims.** Without a clear gate to **–Spec**, normative wording appears without testability.

| **Simplicity vs rigour**     | Easy‑to‑learn naming vs the need for machine‑checkable invariants.                |
| **Universality vs locality** | Kernel intensions must be universal; language and criteria are **Context‑local**. |

### 4 · Solution — the I/D/S layer + a formal Spec‑gate

#### 4.1 The triad (applies to **any** intensional `U.T`)

**Terminology discipline (normative).** Say **I/D/S layers** when you mean the **stratified order with a Spec‑gate**; say **I/D/S triad** only to note **three‑ness without order or dependency**. **Do not call I/D/S a “plane”.** Reserve **plane** for uses explicitly defined elsewhere (e.g., **`CHR:ReferencePlane`** and status families).
**Layer semantics (clarity).** **I‑layer** = **kernel/intensional type** (non‑epistemic; **not** a episteme) . **D‑layer** and **S‑layer** = **epistemic Knowledge Units** (KUs). The **Spec‑gate** upgrades a Description to a Specification only under declared checkability and harness conditions (unchanged).

For every intensional type `U.T`:

* **Intension — `U.T`.**
  The thing itself (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Service`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.RCS`, `U.RSG`).
  *It does **not** contain documents, checklists, or carriers; it is not a runtime event or a file.*

* **Description episteme — `U.TDescription(@Context)`**
  A **Context‑local** knowledge unit that **characterises** `U.T` with labels (Tech/Plain), glosses, and, when applicable, **Role Characterisation Space (`U.RCS`)**, **Role State Graph (`U.RSG`)**, and **state conformance checklists**.
  *Readable, precise, didactic; may reference evaluation criteria but does not assert testable “shall”s by itself.*

* **Specification episteme — `U.TSpec(@Context)`**
  A **Context‑local** knowledge unit that states **testable invariants** for `U.T` and is **bound to an acceptance harness**.
  *Normative, verifiable, suitable for SCR/RSCR (F.15).*

> **Key phrasing discipline.** Intensions are **characterised by** (not “contain”) RCS/RSG/checklists, which **live in** the Description/Spec.
> **Terminology guard.** To avoid collisions with **ReferencePlane** and other semantic planes, the I/D/S triad is referred to as **I/D/S Layers** (Intension Layer · Description Layer · Specification Layer). The word **plane** is reserved for **semantic planes** (Role/Status/Measurement/Type‑structure/Method/Work, etc.) and for the **ReferencePlane** field used in describedEntity/assurance.

#### 4.2 The Spec‑gate (when “–Spec” is allowed)

Use the **–Spec** suffix **only if all** of the following hold:

1. **Formality F (C.2.3):** the artefact declares **F ≥ F4** (or a context-defined higher threshold) so predicates are checkable.
2. **Verifiability:** invariants are stated as checkable predicates or thresholds.
3. **Harness bound:** there is a linked **acceptance harness** (SCR/RSCR matrices per F.15).
4. **Context anchoring:** all wording is explicitly local to a named `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1).

If any condition is missing, the artefact **must be** a `…Description`.

#### 4.3 Where RCS/RSG and evaluations sit

* **`U.RCS` (Role Characterisation Space)** and **`U.RSG` (Role State Graph)** are **intensional** types that structure the space of role characteristics and permissible state transitions.
* Their **human presentation** (characteristics, dimensions, node labels, admissible transitions) lives in the **RoleDescription**, and becomes part of **RoleSpec** only when the transitions and state predicates are made **testable** and harness‑bound.
* **`U.Evaluation`** operates on **evidence** against the conformance checklist (from the Description/Spec) to produce a **state attestation** (“X is in state S @Context within window W”).
* **Epistemic/deontic statuses** (e.g., *Evidence*, *Requirement*, *Standard*) are **roles over Epistemes** (not states of the role). They are governed elsewhere (F‑R family) and must not be conflated with `U.RSG` state names.

#### 4.4 Plain‑language memory hook

> *Thing vs words vs rules.*
> **The thing** (`U.Role`, `U.Method`) is clean and abstract.
> **The words** (labels, glosses, RCS/RSG pictures, checklists) live in the **Description**.
> **The rules** (testable “shall”s with harness) live in the **Specification**.
> If you can’t test it, don’t call it **Spec**.

### 5 · Minimal vocabulary & naming discipline (this pattern only)

**Core trio (per intensional `U.T`).**

* **`U.T` — the Intension.**
  Kernel object (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Service`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.RCS`, `U.RSG`).
  *Never* a document, *never* an event, *never* a file.

* **`U.TDescription(@Context)` — the Description Episteme.**
  Context‑local characterisation of `U.T`: Tech/Plain labels, gloss, notes; for roles, may **characterise** with an `U.RCS` (characteristics/traits), an `U.RSG` (states/transitions), and **state conformance checklists** (per state). *Readable; precise; not yet a set of testable “shall”s.*

* **`U.TSpec(@Context)` — the Specification Episteme.**
  Context‑local, **testable** invariant set for `U.T`, explicitly **bound to an acceptance harness** (SCR/RSCR matrices per F.15). Use **–Spec** only through the Spec‑gate (Sec. 4.2).

**Suffix rules.**

* Use **`…Description`** by default (M‑mode or F‑mode without harness).
* Use **`…Spec`** *only* when **all** Spec‑gate conditions (Sec. 4.2) hold.
* No alternative suffixes (“Profile”, “Definition”, “Guide”) inside the Core; such epistemes live in pedagogy/tooling layers, not in the I/D/S discipline.

**Naming morphology (recap of F.5 as it applies here).**

* Two registers: **Tech** and **Plain** labels on every Description/Spec.
* Roles use **count nouns** (e.g., *Operator*); states use **state nouns** (e.g., *Approved*).
* Statuses over knowledge (e.g., Evidence/Requirement) are **not** role states; they name **roles over Epistemes** (F‑R family), not nodes in `U.RSG`.

**Context anchoring.**
Every Description/Spec is **local to** a `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1). Phrases in the episteme must read correctly once prefixed by the Context name (e.g., “(ITIL4) Acceptance criteria …”).

**Carriers.**
`U.Carrier` holds **encodings** of a Description/Spec; the Episteme’s identity is **not** the file. *Never* say “the role contains the checklist in the PDF”; say “the **RoleDescription** characterises the role with checklists; this **carrier** encodes them.”

**Time stance.**
Descriptions/Specs must declare DesignRunTag when inherent (e.g., RoleDescription is design‑time; state attestation via `U.Evaluation` is run‑time).

### 6 · Invariants (normative)

**IDS‑1 (Plane purity).**
An intensional `U.T` **MUST NOT** be conflated with its Description/Spec or with any `U.Carrier` or `U.Work`.

**IDS‑2 (Context locality).**
Every `…Description/…Spec` **MUST** name a `U.BoundedContext`. Wording inside is read **as‑local**; no global meaning is implied.

**IDS-3 (Spec-gate).**
A episteme **MUST NOT** use the **–Spec** suffix unless: *(a)* the artefact declares **`U.Formality = Fk` with k ≥ 4** per **C.2.3**, *(b)* invariants are testable predicates, *(c)* an acceptance harness is linked (F.15), *(d)* Context is explicit.

**IDS‑4 (Characterisation verbs).**
Texts **MUST** say: *“`U.Role` is **characterised by** `U.RCS`/`U.RSG` in the RoleDescription”*.
They **MUST NOT** say: *“the role **contains** the RCS/RSG”*.

**IDS‑5 (RCS/RSG scope).**
`U.RCS`/`U.RSG` are **intensional structures**. Their **presentations** (characteristics, state names, admissible transitions, checklists) live in the **RoleDescription**, and in **RoleSpec** only when transitions and state predicates are fully testable.

**IDS‑6 (Evaluation semantics).**
`U.Evaluation` **MUST** operate over evidence against conformance checklists from the Description/Spec and **MUST** produce a **state attestation** (who/what is in state *S* @Context within window *W*). Evaluation **does not** mutate the intensional object.

**IDS‑7 (Status separation).**
Epistemic/deontic statuses (Evidence/Requirement/Standard) are roles over **knowledge units**; they **MUST NOT** be used as state names in `U.RSG`.

**IDS‑8 (Register discipline).**
Every Description/Spec **SHOULD** include both **Tech** and **Plain** labels. Symbolic aliases are optional and informative.

**IDS‑9 (No stealth bridges).**
Descriptions/Specs **MUST NOT** import meanings from other Contexts by shared labels. Cross‑context relations exist only as **F.9 Bridges**.

**IDS‑10 (Window honesty).**
When an evaluation is time‑bounded, the **window** **MUST** be stated in the attestation.

**IDS‑11 (Ladder clarity).**
A Description may mature into a Spec by satisfying IDS‑3; the opposite move requires a rationale (loss of testability) and must drop the **–Spec** suffix.

**IDS‑12 (Didactic bound).**
A RoleDescription **SHOULD** fit on one screen per state graph plus one screen of notes; sprawling documents belong to pedagogy, not to the core Description.

### 7 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Judgements are **mental moves**—they assert what follows when premises hold. They do **not** imply queries, storage, or workflows.

1. **Description link (with DescriptionContext)**

   ```
   U.T, C, Vp ⊢ isDescriptionOf(TDesc, U.T, C, Vp)
   ```

   *Reading:* `TDesc` is the Context‑local Description of `U.T` in Context `C` under Viewpoint `Vp`. Its `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef(U.T), C, Vp⟩` (IDS‑13, C.2.1 §6.1).

2. **Spec link (Spec‑gate, viewpoint‑local)**

   ```
   isDescriptionOf(TDesc, U.T, C, Vp) ∧ U.Formality(TSpec) ≥ F4
      ∧ testableInvariants(TSpec) ∧ harnessBound(TSpec)
      ∧ sameDescriptionContext(TSpec, TDesc)
      ⊢ isSpecOf(TSpec, U.T, C, Vp)
   ```

   *Reading:* Only when F‑mode, testability, harness, and a matching `DescriptionContext` are present may we judge `TSpec` a Specification of `U.T` in `C` under Viewpoint `Vp`.

3. **Role characterisation**

  ```
   isDescriptionOf(RoleDesc, U.Role, C, Vp)
   ∧ characterises(RoleDesc, U.RCS) ∧ characterises(RoleDesc, U.RSG)
   ⊢ characterisedBy(U.Role, {U.RCS, U.RSG}) @C
  ```

   *Reading:* The role is *characterised by* the RCS/RSG as presented in the Description (which is pinned to `(C, Vp)`), not that it “contains” them.

4. **State conformance predicate**

   ```
   checklistFor(RoleDesc, state S) = χ
   ∧ evidence E within window W
   ⊢ conformsToState(E, χ, W) ⇒ attestation(subject ∈ S @C, W)
   ```

   *Reading:* Evidence satisfies the checklist for state `S`, yielding a state attestation.

5. **Transition admissibility**

   ```
   U.RSG allows (S → S') @C
   ∧ attestation(subject ∈ S @C, W)
   ∧ conformsToState(E', checklistFor(S'), W')
   ⊢ admissibleTransition(subject : S → S' @C)
   ```

   *Reading:* A move from `S` to `S'` is admissible when RSG permits it and `S'` is satisfied.

6. **Status / state separation guard**

   ```
   statusOverKU(KU, σ) ∧ stateInRSG(ρ)
   ⊢ σ ≠ ρ  (distinct planes)
   ```

   *Reading:* A status over a knowledge unit is not a role‑state.

7. **No Cross‑context import**

   ```
   isDescriptionOf(TDescA, U.T, CA, VpA) ∧ isDescriptionOf(TDescB, U.T, CB, VpB) ∧ CA≠CB
   ⊢ ¬equateByLabel(TDescA, TDescB)  (bridges required in F.9)
   ```

   *Reading:* Identical wording across Contexts (and Viewpoints) does not grant equivalence; only Bridges may relate them.

| ---- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A‑1  | **Spec‑by‑name**            | Every write‑up is titled “Spec”.                                     | Inflates normativity; untestable claims.  | Apply **Spec‑gate** (IDS‑3). If any condition fails, rename to `…Description`.                 |
| A‑2  | **Role contains RSG**       | “The role contains a state graph.”                                   | Plane mixing; mereological confusion.     | Use **characterised by** phrasing (IDS‑4); RSG presentation lives in RoleDescription/RoleSpec. |
| A‑3  | **Status ≡ state**          | *Approved* (status over episteme)  appears as a node in the role graph.     | Cross‑plane conflation; logic errors.     | Keep **statuses** (over Epistemes) separate from **role states** (IDS‑7).                            |
| A‑4  | **Stealth bridge**          | Copying state names across Contexts to imply sameness.                  | Hidden cross‑context import.              | Declare an **F.9 Bridge** or accept divergence (IDS‑9).                                        |
| A‑5  | **Checklist = process**     | Treating conformance checklist as an execution workflow.             | Category error (design vs run).           | Checklists are **criteria** used by `U.Evaluation`; executions live under `U.Work`.            |
| A‑6  | **Carrier identity**        | File path/version treated as “the spec itself.”                      | Identity drift; archival brittleness.     | Identity is the **KU**; `U.Carrier` is only an encoding (Sec. 5).                              |
| A‑7  | **Windowless verdict**      | Attestations omit time window.                                       | Unreproducible results; stale judgements. | Require **window** in attestation (IDS‑10).                                                    |
| A‑8  | **Over‑formal Description** | Description bloats into a standard; unreadable.                      | Violates didactics; blocks adoption.      | Enforce **one‑screen** discipline (IDS‑12); move exegesis to pedagogy.                         |
| A‑9  | **Spec without harness**    | “Shall” statements with no linked acceptance matrices.               | Unverifiable normativity.                 | Bind to **SCR/RSCR harness** (F.15) or downgrade to Description (IDS‑3).                       |
| A‑10 | **Global language leakage** | Description reads as universal definition rather than Context‑local. | Breaks locality; fuels conflicts.         | Prefix mentally with the Context; rewrite locally (IDS‑2).                                        |

### 9 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory, didactic)

> Each vignette shows **intension ↔ Description/Spec ↔ Evaluation** with **context‑local** wording. No workflows; only thinking moves.

#### 9.1 Enactment (Role Assignment & Enactment line) — *Change Authority* role (ITIL 4 Context)

**Contexts.** `ITIL4_2020` (services/deontics), `PROV_O_2013` (run‑time traces).
**Intension.** `U.Role :: ChangeAuthority` — a behavioural mask that may be worn by a system (person/team/tool) to **authorise** a change.

**RoleDescription\@ITIL4.**

* **Tech/Plain.** *ChangeAuthority* / “change approver”.
* **RCS (characteristics).** CredentialLevel ∈ {L1,L2}; Scope ∈ {Service, Platform}; SeparationOfDuty ∈ {Clean, Violates}.
* **RSG (states).** `Proposed → Designated → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked`.
* **State checklists (sketch).**

  * *Authorized:* { valid nomination, SoD=Clean, credential ≥ required, mandate window set }.
  * *Active:* *Authorized* ∧ { current shift/roster entry ∧ no conflicting active duty }.

**Evaluations.**
`U.Evaluation@ITIL4` over evidence (roster entries, mandate doc, SoD list, PROV Activities of approvals) yields **attestations**:

* `subject=Team‑X ∈ Authorized@ITIL4 in ⟨2025‑08‑01, 2025‑12‑31⟩`.
* Later, `subject=Team‑X ∈ Active@ITIL4 at 2025‑09‑14T10:05Z`.

**Didactic hooks.**

* The **role** is *characterised by* RCS/RSG in the **RoleDescription**; it **does not contain** them.
* The **attestation** is a statement about state‑in‑window; it does **not** mutate the role.

#### 9.2 Method (Essence‑language Context) — *Backlog Refinement* method

**Contexts.** `OMG_Essence_Language_2023` (method language), `PROV_O_2013` (runtime).
**Intension.** `U.Method :: BacklogRefinement`.

**MethodDescription\@Essence.**

* **Tech/Plain.** *BacklogRefinement* / “tidy backlog”.
* **Inputs/Outputs (informative).** Work items (ideas) → clarified items (ready/not‑ready tags).
* **RCS (characteristics).** Cadence ∈ {weekly, continuous}; CollaborationMode ∈ {sync, async}.
* **RSG (states).** `Sketched → Defined → Adopted`.
* **State checklist (Adopted).** { team agreed practice note exists, cadence set, entry/exit criteria published }.

**Spec‑gate outcome.**
No acceptance harness yet → remains **MethodDescription**, **not** MethodSpec.

**Run‑time echo.**
`U.Work` instances (calendar sessions, chat threads) are traced in PROV; **Evaluation** can check whether an *Adopted* practice is being followed in window W without ever reifying the method as a workflow.

#### 9.3 Service (SLO/SLA) — *Calibration Service* (ITIL 4 + SOSA/SSN Contexts)

**Contexts.** `ITIL4_2020` (service), `SOSA_SSN_2017` (observation), `ISO_80000_1_2022` (units).
**Intension.** `U.Service :: CalibrationService`.

**ServiceDescription\@ITIL4.**

* **Tech/Plain.** *CalibrationService* / “we calibrate your sensor”.
* **Acceptance facet (informative).** *SLO: error ≤ 0.5% FS under ISO 80000 units*; **formal criteria live in** ServiceSpec only if harness exists.

**Evaluation\@ITIL4+SOSA.**
Observations (SOSA) from test runs compared with thresholds → **ServiceEvaluation** attests *Met/Not‑Met* in a stated window.
No Cross‑context import: ISO units cited **as context‑local** references.

#### 9.4 Epistemic (KD‑line) — *Evidence status vs role state*

**Contexts.** `PROV_O_2013` (provenance), `FPF_Evidence_Status` (status family).
**Intensions.** `U.KnowledgeUnit :: Report_42`; `U.EvidenceStatus :: SupportsClaim`.

**Separation.**

* `SupportsClaim@C` is a **status over a Episteme** (classifies the report).
* It is **not** a node of any role’s `U.RSG`.
* `U.Evaluation` produces `attestation(Report_42 has EvidenceStatus=SupportsClaim@C, W)`.

**Didactic point.**
State names in *role* graphs do not duplicate **statuses**; planes stay disjoint.

#### 9.5 Control (Sys‑CAL line) — *Control‑Operator* role (IEC 61131‑3 Context)

**Contexts.** `IEC_61131_3` (control languages), `ISA_95` (integration).
**Intension.** `U.Role :: ControlOperator`.

**RoleDescription\@IEC61131‑3.**

* **RCS.** StationLevel ∈ {Cell, Line}; TaskMode ∈ {Cyclic, Event}; AlarmPrivileges ∈ {Ack, Ack+Shelve}.
* **RSG.** `Onboarded → Authorized → ConsoleActive → Paused → Suspended`.
* **Checklists (ConsoleActive).** { Authorized ∧ current console login ∧ task watchlist loaded }.

**Attestation (run‑time).**
`subject=Operator‑A ∈ ConsoleActive@IEC at 2025‑09‑14T08:00Z` based on log evidence.
No “workflow” required in the Description.

### 10 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**

* **E.10.D1 — Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX).** Provides the *Context* primitive and bans “anchor” talk.
* **A.7 — Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice).** This pattern concretises SD for intension vs description/spec vs carrier vs work.
* **C.2.3 — Unified Formality Characteristic (F).** Supplies the **F** anchors and **ΔF** moves that gate `…Spec`.

**Constrains:**

* **F.1–F.3 (Contexts → seeds → local senses).** Descriptions **must** cite context‑local senses (SenseCells) rather than global words.
* **F.4–F.5 (role/service naming).** Tech/Plain labels on Descriptions obey F.5 morphology rules.
* **F.8 (Service Acceptance Binding).** Evaluations of services read acceptance **from Description/Spec**, compare against Observations.
* **F.9 (Alignment & Bridge).** No Description/Spec may imply Cross‑context equivalence; Bridges carry all Cross‑context semantics.
* **F.15 (SCR/RSCR Harness).** Any `…Spec` must link to its harness; RSCR re‑checks verdict stability across editions/windows.

**Is used by.**

* **Part C architheories.** Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Kind-CAL, Method‑CAL cite `…Description/…Spec` epistemes explicitly and consume **state attestations** from `U.Evaluation`.
* **Part B trust calculus.** Uses the presence/absence of harnessed Specs and the windowed nature of attestations in confidence roll‑ups.

### 11 · Migration notes (conceptual refactor playbook)

> Goal: remove conflations and normalise names without changing underlying models.

1. **Rename by default.** Any `XSpec` lacking a bound acceptance harness becomes **`XDescription`**. Keep content intact; change suffix and preface with a “Description, not Spec” note.
2. **Promote selectively.** For epistemes that *are* testable and declare **F ≥ F4**, add harness links (F.15) and re-label as **`XSpec`** via the Spec-gate.
3. **Fix the verbs.** Rewrite “Role contains RSG/RCS” → “Role is **characterised by** RSG/RCS in RoleDescription”.
4. **Detach carriers.** Replace identity‑by‑file with **`U.Carrier` encodes …Description/Spec** wording.
5. **Add Contexts.** Where a Description drifts globally (“the backlog refinement is…”), prefix with the Context and adjust wording to be **local**.
6. **Split planes.** Move any Evidence/Requirement **statuses** out of role state lists; keep them as roles over **knowledge units**.
7. **Window‑ise verdicts.** Ensure every evaluation statement adds an explicit **window** (instant or interval).
8. **Document maturity.** **Declare each Description’s F** (C.2.3) and track **ΔF** promotions/demotions as part of change notes (no governance implied).

### 12 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

#### 12.1 Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR-D2-S01 (Suffix discipline).** Every episteme with suffix **–Spec** passes the **Spec-gate** (**F ≥ F4** ∧ testable invariants ∧ harness link ∧ Context named). Otherwise it bears **–Description**.
* **SCR‑D2‑S02 (Characterisation verbs).** Texts never say an intension “contains” RCS/RSG; they say it is **characterised by** them via the Description/Spec.
* **SCR‑D2‑S03 (Plane purity).** No episteme mixes role **states** and knowledge **statuses**; each appears only on its correct plane.
* **SCR‑D2‑S04 (context‑locality).** Every Description/Spec names its `U.BoundedContext`; wording reads correctly when prefixed by the Context.
* **SCR‑D2‑S05 (Two registers).** Tech **and** Plain labels present on all Descriptions/Specs.
* **SCR‑D2‑S06 (Carrier separation).** Identity statements refer to Epistemes; files are referenced only as `U.Carrier` encodings.
* **SCR‑D2‑S07 (Windowed evaluation).** All state attestations cite a window `W` (instant or interval).

#### 12.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑D2‑E01 (Spec demotion guard).** If a **–Spec** loses its harness or testability, it is demoted to **–Description**; diffs show no lingering “shall” claims.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E02 (Bridge drift).** If two Contexts begin to share identical labels, verify no Descriptions/Specs imply Cross‑context identity; add or revise **F.9 Bridges** instead.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E03 (Edition churn).** When a Context’s canon updates, previously valid attestations remain historical (windowed); new Specs/Descriptions cite the new edition.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E04 (Verb hygiene).** Automated grep over corpus finds “contains RSG/RCS” phrasing; none remain after refactor.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E05 (Status bleed).** Spot‑audit a random sample of role graphs to ensure no epistemic/deontic statuses appear as role states.

*Didactic takeaway.*
Think in three layers: **Intension** (what the thing *is*), **Description/Spec** (how we *state* its character and, when mature, *test* it), and **Evaluation** (what we can *attest* about it in a **window**). Keep Contexts local, planes separate, and “contains” out of your vocabulary.

### 13 · Author’s pocket guide (carry‑in‑mind rules)

> **Use these as thinking cues, not as paperwork.** Each cue is a one‑breath test you can apply while writing.

1. **Name the Context.** Write “*Role (ITIL4)*”, “*Method (Essence‑language)*”, “*Execution (PROV)*”. Never speak global words.
2. **Pick the *object-of-talk*.** Am I talking about an **intension** (Role/Method/Service), a **Description/Spec**, an **Evaluation**, or a **Carrier**? Stay on one object-of-talk per sentence.
3. **Prefer –Description.** Use **`…Description`** by default. Switch to **`…Spec`** only after the **Spec‑gate** (testable invariants + harness + F‑mode).
4. **Characterised by…** Say *“Role is **characterised by** RCS/RSG recorded in RoleDescription”*, never *“Role **contains** its states”*.
5. **Window every verdict.** An Evaluation must read “*X ∈ State\@context **in** W*”. No naked, timeless verdicts.
6. **Status ≠ state.** Role **states** live in `U.RSG`; Evidence/Requirement **statuses** classify **knowledge units**. Do not mix.
7. **Bridge later.** If two Contexts “feel the same”, write the itch down and leave it for **F.9 Bridge**.
8. **Two registers.** Every Description/Spec has **Tech** and **Plain** labels; prefer the shortest tech term that matches the invariants.
9. **Carrier humility.** Files and records are **Carriers** of Descriptions/Specs; they don’t *equal* the thing you reason about.
10. **Spec = test.** If you can’t point to a harness that would falsify it, it isn’t a **Spec** yet.

#### 15.1 Suffix discipline (recap).**

* **Preferred default:** **`…Description`** for Role/Method/Service/Work.
* **Reserved:** **`…Spec`** only if the item passed the **Spec‑gate** (F‑mode, testable invariants, harness id, Context named).
* **Banned:** Using **–Spec** as a synonym for “detailed description”.

#### 15.3 Verb & morphology rules.**

* **Verbs.** Use *characterised by*, *recorded in*, *encoded by*; avoid *contains*, *is stored in*, *is implemented by* when speaking at the conceptual level.
* **Morphology.**

  * Roles name **masks** as **count nouns** (*Operator, ChangeAuthority*).
  * States as **state nouns/participles** (*Authorized, Active*).
  * Status names are **classifiers over knowledge** (*SupportsClaim, NormativeStandard*).
  * Descriptions/Specs use neutral nouns (*RoleDescription, MethodSpec*).

#### 15.4 Deprecations (effective now).**

* **MethodSpec** (as a general name) → **MethodDescription** unless Spec‑gate is met.
* **WorkSpec** (alias for WorkPlan) → **WorkDescription** (allowed alias), or **U.WorkPlan** (preferred).
* Texts must avoid “contains RSG/RCS” phrasing (see RSCR‑D2‑E04).

### 16 · Quick templates (fill‑in‑mind, not forms)

> Copy these **lines** into your prose as thinking scaffolds. They are not schemas, fields, or checklists to fill; they are didactic prompts.

### 16.1 Role (default).

* *Intension.* `U.Role :: <TechName> in <ContextId>`.
* *RoleDescription\@context.* Tech/Plain: **`<TechName> / <PlainName>`**.

* **RCS characteristics.** `<characteristic₁ ∈ {...}>; <characteristic₂ ∈ {...}>`.
* **RSG nodes (→).** `<S₀ → S₁ → ... → Sₙ>`.
* **State checklist (one node).** `<StateX : {criterion₁, …}>`.
* *Evaluation attestation.* `subject=<Holder> ∈ <StateX>@<ContextId> in <Window> (evidence: <cue₁,…>)`. 

#### 16.2 Method (Essence‑language Context).

* *Intension.* `U.Method :: <TechName>`.
* *MethodDescription\@context.* Inputs/Outputs (informative), **RCS/RSG** (if you track adoption).
* *Spec upgrade (optional).* “Becomes **MethodSpec** when harness `<id>` exists.”

#### 16.3 Service (acceptance‑bearing).**

* *ServiceDescription\@context.* Tech/Plain; **Acceptance facet** (informative until harnessed).
* *Evaluation.* `Service ∈ Met/Not‑Met@context in <Window>` based on observations and acceptance criteria.

#### 16.4 Alignment reminder.

* “No Cross‑context identity is implied; if needed, add **F.9 Bridge**: `<ContextA:TermA> ↔ <ContextB:TermB>` with CL/loss notes.”

### 17 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **“Three layers; one context; no leakage.”**

1. **Pick the Context.** Every word lives **inside** a `U.BoundedContext`.
2. **Pick the I/D/S layer.** Speak about the **Intension (I)**, or about its **Description/Spec (D/S)**—but never mix layers. If your sentence also asserts describedEntity or evidence, **name the `ReferencePlane`** (`world|concept|episteme`).
3. **Describe, then test.** Start with **Role/Method/ServiceDescription**. Only when you can **falsify** it with a harness do you call it a **Spec**.
4. **State is attested.** Role **states** are attested by **Evaluations** as *“X ∈ State\@context **in** W”*. Evidence/Requirement **statuses** classify **knowledge**, not roles.
5. **Carriers carry.** PDFs and repos are **Carriers** of the Description/Spec; they aren’t the thing itself.
6. **Bridges are explicit.** Cross‑context sameness is never assumed; you declare a **Bridge** with CL/loss.
   Follow these six lines and SD (*Strict Distinction*) stops being an abstraction—you feel it in every sentence you write.
   
## E.11 — Authoring‑Tier Scheme (ATS) \[A]

*Tech token:* `AuthoringTierScheme` (**ATS**).

**Object‑of‑talk.** `AuthoringTierScheme` — an **Episteme (Scheme, kind‑anchored)** that classifies **Authoring Work** into four **AuthoringTier** levels and governs **gate‑crossings**, **evidence lanes**, and **normative separation** between the levels.

**Register & scope.** Kernel pattern in Part E, applicable across FPF and reusable by Part G (architheory authoring) and Part C (discipline patterns), with guards per **E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE)** and **C.20 §D.DISC**.

### 1) Intent

Provide a **uniform, testable classification Scheme** for acts of authoring in this project, preventing **normative token leakage** between layers of work, and requiring **explicit publication carriers** (`UTS` rows, `BridgeCard`) for any crossing. The scheme aligns with **USM** by treating each tier as a distinct **Work** class and with **E.10** by enforcing head‑anchored naming and I/D/S morphology.

**Wiring.** ATS is explicitly wired to **A.4 (Temporal Duality & Open‑Ended Evolution Principle)** and **B.4 (Observe→Refine→Deploy)**; the cognitive engine for authoring acts is **B.5/B.5.1 (Explore→Shape→Evidence→Operate)**. Keep **Working‑Model first (Tell–Show–Show)** to avoid gratuitous formalism (per **E.8**). **Telemetry/refresh is consumed by G.11 (PathSlice, decay, edition) via H2–H4/H7/H11 hooks.**

### 2) Problem

Without a disciplined tiering of authoring work:

* **Kinds blur** (execution vs design vs architheory vs meta‑authoring).
* **Tokens leak** (a result minted at one tier is used as if normative at another).
* **Evidence lanes** become non‑comparable; **CL (cross‑context loss)** is unmanaged.
* **“Domain” labels** are mistaken for governance, and job‑title language creeps into kernel tokens.

### 3) Forces

* **Separation of concerns.** Translation from applied problems to transdiscipline tasks must be distinct from architheory authoring and from meta‑authoring.
* **Evidence comparability.** Evidence must run in **lanes** with **CL penalties** recorded and routed.
* **Publication accountability.** Cross‑tier reuse must be visible on **UTS** with **Bridge** entries.
* **Lexical hygiene.** Head‑anchoring, I/D/S morphology, and Role/Holder/Carrier separation must hold across all tiers.
* **Discipline vs Domain.** `U.Discipline` governs comparability **via CG‑Spec**, while **Domain** is catalog‑only and stitched to **D.CTX + UTS**.

### 4) Solution — the Scheme

#### 4.1 The four **AuthoringTier** levels (Tech heads; Plain twins in italics)

**AT0 — `AppliedWork`** *(Plain twin: “Applied‑run”)*

* **Work kind.** Execution of applied methods on situated problems, **outside** FPF’s transdiscipline scope.
* **Typical outputs.** `RunObservation` *(run artefact; cf. `Observation`)*, `WorkLogCarrier`, optional `RunbookMethodDescription`.
* **Normative status inside FPF.** **Non‑normative** to higher tiers; may **inform** AT1 through a **`BridgeCard`** with CL notes.

* **Roles.** `ExecutorRole`, `OperatorRole`; **Holders** are concrete holons (teams/systems).
* **Conformance note.** AT0 tokens **MUST NOT** assert norms for AT1–AT3; **`Work` stays execution‑only**, plans/logs/recipes are modeled as `WorkPlan`/Carriers/`MethodDescription`.

**AT1 — `TransdisciplineDesignWork`** *(Plain twin: “Transdiscipline‑design work”)*

* **Work kind.** Translation of applied problems into **Tasks** and **SoTA‑about‑methods**: methods **about** applied methods.
* **Typical outputs.** `TaskPack`, `TranslationMethodDescription`, `DesignRationaleDescription`.
* **Normative status.** Normative **within AT1**; AT1 tokens **MAY** cite AT0 only through **BridgeCard** with CL captured.
* **Roles.** `DesignerRole`, `TranslatorRole`; **Holders** typed to a `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Scope relation to C.20.** When AT1 uses a discipline, name it as `U.Discipline` (Holon) and place comparison rules in its **CG‑Spec**; **no norms on Domain labels** (stitch Domain mentions to **D.CTX + UTS**).

**AT2 — `ArchitheoryAuthoringWork`** *(Plain twin: “Architheory‑authoring”)*

* **Work kind.** Production of the **SoTA Architheory Pack** used in Part G authoring.
* **Typical outputs.** `ArchitheoryPack`, `GaugeSpec`, `InvariantSetDescription`, `BridgeCard` (AT1↔AT2).
* **Normative status.** AT2 defines the **architheory norm set** (CAL/CHR/LOG) that **feeds** F/G reasoning; it **does not mutate Kernel types** and respects **unidirectional meaning** (Kernel → Architheory → Context → Instance).
* **Portfolio‑aware constraint.** AT2 **MUST** treat **“one signature → many specialisations”** as the norm: do **not** embed **global thresholds** or **forced scalarisations** inside architheory text; selection remains **set‑valued** (Pareto/Archive) under **G.5**, with dominance governed by **CAL** policies. Any maturity floors **SHALL** be expressed via **`CAL.AcceptanceClause`** (clause id cited), not inside LOG.
* **Roles.** `AuthorRole`, `AssessorRole` (review within AT2), `StewardRole` (pack upkeep).
* **Cross‑tier references.** Cite AT1 only through a `BridgeCard` with CL captured **and a matching UTS row**.
* **Evidence.** Publishes **UTS rows** for visibility and **BridgeCard** for any cross‑tier references.

**AT3 — `MetaAuthoringWork`** *(Plain twin: “Meta‑authoring”)*

* **Work kind.** Organisation and governance of AT2 work (e.g., editorial coordination).
* **Typical outputs.** `CoordinationFlowDescription`, `AuthoringPolicySpec`, `PublicationPlanDescription`.
* **Normative status.** AT3 **organises** but **does not overrule** AT2 invariants; under **KD‑CAL/B.3**, AT3 **MUST NOT** alter AT2 **F/G invariants** nor introduce cross‑lane mutations; it sets **how** AT2 is executed, not **what** architheory is true.
* **Roles.** `CoordinatorRole`, `EditorRole`, `DisciplineStewardRole` (if a `U.Discipline` is orchestrated).
* **Evidence.** Publishes **UTS rows** for visibility and **BridgeCard** for any cross‑tier references.

> **USM alignment.** Each AT\* is a **Work** class (USM *act*). Tokens produced at a tier are **typed** to that tier’s Work class and **obey E.10** lexical governance.

#### 4.2 Tiering for autonomy budgets & guards
* **AT0/AT1** (application/bridge authors): may **use** existing `AutonomyBudgetDecl` and `Aut-Guard policy-id` and populate UTS fields; **MUST NOT** create new guard policies.
* **AT2** (architheory users): may **author** context‑local `AutonomyBudgetDecl` that instantiates an existing `Aut-Guard` policy and `OverrideProtocolRef`.
* **AT3** (architheory maintainers): may **mint/modify** `Aut-Guard` policies and **register** `OverrideProtocolRef` speech‑act schemas.
**Gate.** Any UTS row referencing a **new** `Aut-Guard policy-id` without AT3 provenance **fails** ATS checks.

### 5) Gate‑crossings & Evidence lanes

#### 5.1 Gate‑crossing requirement

A **GateCrossing** between tiers (e.g., AT0→AT1, AT1→AT2, AT2→AT3) **MUST** be recorded as:

1. a **`BridgeCard`** linking source tokens to target tokens (with **BridgeId** and **CL** loss notes), and
2. a **UTS row** listing: SourceTier, TargetTier, `ContextId` (from **D.CTX**), **BridgeId**, **bridgeChannel ∈ {Scope, Kind}**, **CL** (and **CL^k** if a **KindBridge** is used) with loss notes, **ReferencePlane** (source/target), **CL^plane** (if planes differ), steward Holder, and twin labels.

**ReferencePlane guard.** When a GateCrossing touches differing planes `{world|concept|episteme}`, compute and publish **CL^plane** (policy‑id + loss note) alongside CL.
* **Evidence.** Publishes **UTS rows** for visibility and **BridgeCard** for any cross‑tier references.

#### 5.2 Evidence lanes & CL routing

**Lane taxonomy (normative).**  
  — **F‑lane (Form):** mechanism‑internal laws (units/coherence, law‑set invariants, type/domain/range). Aggregation default: **min**; unaffected by CL penalties.  
  — **G‑lane (Grounding):** scope coverage and applicability to the declared `PublicationScope`. Aggregation: **intersection along a path; SpanUnion across independent lines**.  
  — **R‑lane (Assurance):** residual risk/assurance accounting; receives **Φ(CL)**/**Ψ(`CL^k`)**/**Φ_plane** penalties (all **monotone, bounded, table‑backed**) that **do not** mutate F/G.  
Materialisation: **SCR/RSCR** carry lane‑split; **UTS rows** cite policy‑ids and `CrossingRef`s; **VALATA** tables provide value annotations; carriers stay referenced via SCR/RSCR.

* **Lane separation.** Keep **Form (F)**, **Grounding (G)**, **Assurance (R)** evidence **disentangled** across all tiers (publish lanes explicitly).
* **CL routing.** Under **KD‑CAL**, **CL/CL^k/CL^plane penalties route to R only** and **MUST NOT** mutate F/G invariants. When planes differ, apply **CL^plane** in the assurance penalty; **Φ(CL)**/**Ψ(CL^k)**/**Φ_plane** MUST be **monotone** and **table‑backed**; publish **policy‑ids** in SCR **and cite them on the UTS row**.
* **Lane provenance.** Each evidence item carries: `LaneId`, `SourceTier`, `ContextId`, `BridgeId` (if imported), **ReferencePlane**, and (if applicable) **CL^plane**.

#### 5.3 Telemetry & Refresh hooks (normative)

* **Sentinel registration.** Every GateCrossing **MUST** register the **BridgeId** on a **PathSlice watch‑list**; edits to **CL/CL^k/CL^plane** or relevant **Φ/Ψ policy‑ids** **MUST** trigger **path‑local RSCR** and schedule **PathSlice** refresh (Γ_time × plane), not pack‑wide reruns.
* **Edition awareness.** Where Bridges reference **`U.DescriptorMapRef`**, **`DistanceDefRef`**, or **`InsertionPolicyRef`** (for archives), any **edition change** **MUST** be published to Telemetry and **MUST** trigger the same path‑local refresh.
* **Dominance policy.** **Illumination/QD signals do not alter dominance by default**; `DominanceRegime` **defaults to `ParetoOnly`**. Participation of illumination in dominance **MUST** be authorised by a **CAL policy** and **MUST** be cited by policy‑id in SCR.
* **Open‑Ended (GeneratorFamily) crossings.** Where a GateCrossing imports evidence from **`GeneratorFamily`** flows (POET‑class) — e.g., **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** or **`TransferRulesRef`** — **register the BridgeId on the PathSlice watch‑list**; any **`…Ref.edition`** change **MUST** be published to Telemetry and **MUST** trigger a **path‑local RSCR/refresh**. Report **`IlluminationSummary`** as a **gauge**; dominance remains unaffected unless a **CAL** policy promotes it (policy‑id cited).

### 6) Interfaces to **C.20 §D.DISC** and **D.CTX / UTS**

* **Discipline usage.** When referencing a field (e.g., “Transdiscipline”), name it as **`U.Discipline` (Holon)**. Put comparability/aggregation in its **CG‑Spec**; do **not** attach norms to a **Domain** label.
* **Domain as catalog mark.** If “Domain” appears, **stitch** it to an **enumerated set of `U.BoundedContext` ids** (per **D.CTX**) and publish **UTS twins**. **Domain carries zero governance.** **Do not attach TaskSignature governance to Domain**; attach comparability/aggregation norms to the **CG‑Spec of U.Discipline**. C.22 **KindSet** supplies describedEntity; **USM** supplies Scope.
* **Traditions vs “Traditions.”** Sub‑disciplinary “Traditions” appear as **`Tradition`** tokens (Tech). Keep “Tradition” only as a **Plain twin** with a twin‑label.

### 7) Roles, Holders, and Carriers (holonic separation)

* **Role tokens.** `DesignerRole`, `TranslatorRole`, `AuthorRole`, `AssessorRole`, `ReviewerRole`, `CoordinatorRole`, `EditorRole`, `DisciplineStewardRole`.
* **Holders.** Use **`Holder#…Role:ContextId`** to type a role assumption, e.g., `Team‑Alpha is Holder#AuthorRole:Architheory‑Lab‑G`.
* **Carriers.** Use **Carrier** for systems that **bear epistemes**: `ArchitheoryPackCarrier`, `UTSRegisterCarrier`, `BridgeRegisterCarrier`.
* **Canonical rewrites.** Legacy `…CarrierRole` → **`Holder#…Role:Context`** (SCR‑LEX).

### 8) I/D/S morphology (applied here)

* **Intension.** `AuthoringTierScheme` (the Scheme itself).
* **Description.** `AuthoringTierSchemeDescription` (this pattern text).
* **Spec (optional, testable).** `AuthoringTierSchemeSpec` — when acceptance criteria and harnesses per **E.10.D2** are published. See §9.

### 9) Conformance (normative)

**C1 — Head‑anchoring.** All tokens minted under this Scheme **MUST** use explicit heads (`Work`, `MethodDescription`, `Pack`, `Spec`, `FlowDescription`, `BridgeCard`, `…Role`, `…Carrier`) and declare **`LEX.TokenClass`**. Figurative heads (e.g., “Ladder”) are **Plain only** with a 1:1 twin to the Tech token.

**C2 — I/D/S.** Use `…Description` for descriptive texts and `…Spec` only when acceptance criteria + harnesses are declared and executable (per **E.10.D2**).

**C3 — Role/Holon separation.** Use `…Role` for playable intentions; **Holders** assume roles via `Holder#…Role:ContextId`. Keep **Carrier** for systems that bear epistemes. Avoid job titles as kernel heads.

**C4 — Tier containment.**

* **C4.1.** Tokens minted at AT0–AT3 are **scoped** to their tier; **normative content MUST NOT leak** to another tier **without** a `BridgeCard` and **UTS row**.
* **C4.2.** AT3 (MetaAuthoring) **MUST NOT** override AT2 invariants; it may only constrain execution/coordination.

**C5 — Evidence lanes.** Publish F/G/R lanes; **route CL→R only**, record **Φ(CL)** and (if applicable) **Φ_plane**; **no F/G mutation**. Provenance includes **ReferencePlane** on crossings.

**C6 — Domain/Discipline governance.**

* **C6.1.** `U.Discipline` is a **Holon**; comparability rules live in **CG‑Spec**.
* **C6.2.** Any **Domain** mention must include the D.CTX projection and **UTS twins**; **no norms on Domain**.

**C7 — Gate‑crossings.** Every cross‑tier reuse **MUST** provide: `BridgeCard` + `UTS` row (with **ReferencePlane**, **bridgeChannel**, **CL**, **CL^k** *if* `bridgeChannel=Kind`, and **CL^plane** where applicable). No implied crossings.

**C8 — Minimal publication set.**

* AT0↔AT1: `BridgeCard`, `TaskPack` (AT1), CL notes, UTS row.
* AT1↔AT2: `BridgeCard`, `ArchitheoryPack` (AT2), lane mapping, UTS row.
* AT2↔AT3: `BridgeCard`, `CoordinationFlowDescription` (AT3), `AuthoringPolicySpec` (if present), UTS row.

**C9 — ATS harness is blocking.** Failures of **AH‑1..AH‑4** *(Classifier, Gate, Lane, Lexical)* **SHALL** block publication under this Scheme; a non‑conformant crossing **MUST NOT** be consumable by **G.4/G.5**. Record the failure as an **SCR** defect with a remediation note.

**Acceptance harness skeleton (for `AuthoringTierSchemeSpec`).**

* **AH‑1 (Classifier).** A deterministic classifier that maps a candidate **Work** record to {AT0|AT1|AT2|AT3} based on its **object‑of‑talk**, outputs, lane types, and declared Roles.
* **AH‑2 (Gate check).** Given a citation across tiers, verifier **MUST** find a `BridgeCard` and matching **UTS row**; **if `bridgeChannel=Kind`, `CL^k` MUST be present** and **Ψ‑policy id** is visible in SCR.
* **AH‑3 (Lane check).** Verifier **MUST** observe **CL/CL^k/CL^plane → R only**, **F/G invariants unchanged**, and — where planes differ — **CL^plane** presence with **Φ_plane** monotone/bounded and table‑backed; SCR shows **R_eff** as a function of Φ/Ψ terms. **When QD/OEE surfaces are present, edition pins MUST be visible**: `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` *(if present)*, and (for OEE) `TransferRulesRef.edition`.
* **AH‑4 (Lexical check).** Head‑anchoring + I/D/S + Role/Holon separation checks (SCR‑LEX).

### **Pattern E.12 — Didactic Primacy & Cognitive Ergonomics \[A] 

**Context**

The FPF is designed as an "Operating System for Thought," a tool intended to augment and clarify human (and artificial) reasoning. This mission places a unique demand on its architecture: the framework's internal elegance and formal power are secondary to its primary function of being understandable and usable. A perfectly consistent but incomprehensible system fails in its didactic purpose. As formal mechanisms like `Assurance Levels` and epistemic scores are introduced, there is a significant risk that the pursuit of these metrics becomes an end in itself, overshadowing the ultimate goal of fostering clearer thought.

**Problem**

If the framework's design prioritizes theoretical purity or formal completeness over cognitive ergonomics, it becomes vulnerable to two critical failure modes:

1.  **Goodhart's Law:** When a measure (like `AssuranceLevel:L2`) becomes the primary target, it ceases to be a good measure of genuine understanding. Teams may start "gaming the metrics," producing artifacts that are formally perfect but conceptually shallow or pragmatically useless.
2.  **Cognitive Overload & Rejection:** The framework becomes so dense, jargon-laden, and procedurally complex that its users—the very agents it is meant to serve—either burn out or abandon it in favor of simpler, albeit less rigorous, methods. The "Operating System for Thought" devolves into a bureaucratic machine for certification.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Formal Rigor vs. Human Usability** | How to build a system that is both formally sound and cognitively accessible, without sacrificing one for the other. |
| **Intrinsic Complexity vs. Incidental Complexity**| How to distinguish the necessary cognitive load inherent in solving a difficult problem from the unnecessary friction imposed by a poorly designed framework. |
| **Means vs. Ends** | How to ensure that the production of high-quality artifacts (the means) always serves the ultimate goal of enhancing an agent's cognitive capabilities (the end). |

**Solution**

FPF elevates **Didactic Primacy (Pillar P-2)** to a normative architectural principle, operationalized through two conceptual mechanisms designed to act as a permanent counterbalance to excessive formalism.

**1. The Principle of Didactic Primacy (Expanded Definition)**

The primary purpose of the FPF is to enhance the cognitive capabilities (`U.Capability`/`Mastery`) of an Agent (`U.Agent`) in service of its Objectives (`U.Objective`). The creation of artifacts with high assurance levels and epistemic scores is a *means to that end, not the end itself*. Any architectural decision that increases formal rigor at the cost of clarity or usability must be explicitly justified by a demonstrable gain in the agent's ability to reason effectively.

**2. Mechanism 1: The Rationale Mandate**

Every key assurance artifact (such as a `U.AssuranceCase` or `Proof`) **MUST** contain a mandatory, human-readable **`rationale`** component.

*   **Nature:** The `rationale` is not a technical description but a narrative explanation.
*   **Content:** It **MUST** answer the question: *"How does achieving this level of formal assurance tangibly help the agent better understand the problem or make a more reliable decision?"*
*   **Purpose:** This mandate forces a moment of reflection, formally linking the act of formalization back to its pragmatic, cognitive purpose. An empty or perfunctory rationale indicates that the assurance work may be an exercise in formalism for its own sake.

> **Didactic Note for Managers: The "So What?" Test**
>
> The Rationale Mandate is FPF's built-in "So What?" test. When your team presents a complex, formally verified artifact (`AssuranceLevel:L2`), the `rationale` is where they answer your fundamental question: "This is impressive, but *so what*? How does this help us ship a better product, make a smarter investment, or avoid a critical risk?" If the answer isn't clear and compelling in the `rationale`, the formal work may have been a waste of resources. It keeps your most brilliant minds focused on creating value, not just elegant proofs.

**3. Mechanism 2: The Human-Factor Loop (HF-Loop)**

To provide a continuous, self-correcting mechanism against cognitive overload, FPF introduces a conceptual feedback loop.

*   **Core Concept:** The HF-Loop is a formal method of inquiry designed to distinguish between the *essential complexity* of the problem being solved and the *incidental complexity* introduced by the FPF itself.
*   **Trigger Concept:** A review is triggered when the **subjective cognitive workload** associated with using the framework exceeds a conceptual threshold. This is not about performance metrics, but about the perceived mental effort required to use FPF's concepts and structures.
*   **Review Concept:** When triggered, a formal review is conducted by individuals in roles that specialize in human-centric perspectives, such as the **`Ethicist`** and **`UX Design Critic`**.
*   **Output Concept:** The review produces a set of proposed **conceptual simplifications** or **didactic improvements** to the framework's patterns or architheories. These are then submitted as formal change proposals (DRRs).

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-E12.1 (Rationale Mandate):** Every `U.AssuranceCase` or `Proof` artifact at `AssuranceLevel:L2` **MUST** contain a non-empty `rationale` component that satisfies the "So What?" test.
*   **CC-E12.2 (HF-Loop Trigger Condition):** Each architheory that defines a significant workflow **SHOULD** specify a conceptual condition for triggering an HF-Loop review, based on the principle of managing cognitive load.
*   **CC-E12.3 (HF-Loop Review Mandate):** If a trigger condition is met, a review involving the designated human-centric roles **MUST** be initiated. Its outcome **MUST** be a documented set of conceptual refinement proposals.
*   **CC-E12.4 (Didactic Primacy in DRRs):** Any DRR proposing a change to a normative pattern **MUST** include a section analyzing its impact on cognitive ergonomics and didactic clarity.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Ivory Tower" Framework** | The FPF specification becomes a beautiful but impenetrable fortress of abstract logic that no practicing engineer can actually use. | The **HF-Loop** provides a formal channel for user feedback to drive conceptual simplification. The roles of `UX Design Critic` and `Ethicist` are constitutionally empowered to challenge complexity that does not serve a clear purpose. |
| **The "Meaningless Rationale"** | The `rationale` field is filled with boilerplate text like "To increase assurance," without any real connection to the problem. | The "So What?" test is part of the review process for L2 artifacts. A perfunctory `rationale` is grounds for rejecting the artifact's promotion to L2, forcing the author to articulate the *real* value of their formal work. |
| **Glorifying Complexity** | A culture emerges where the most complex and difficult-to-understand models are considered the "best," regardless of their utility. | The core principle of **Cognitive Elegance (P-1)** and the mechanisms in this pattern create a constant pressure towards simplicity and clarity. The framework formally values understanding over mere complexity. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guards FPF's Core Mission:** This pattern acts as an "immune system," protecting the framework from devolving into sterile formalism and ensuring it remains a tool for enhancing thought. | **Introduces "Softer" Concepts:** Cognitive load and rationale quality are less quantifiable than formal proofs. *Mitigation:* FPF operationalizes them through a formal method. The HF-Loop is a structured inquiry, not an informal chat. |
| **Empowers Human-Centric Roles:** It gives the `Ethicist` and `UX Design Critic` roles a concrete, constitutional function in the evolution of the framework. | - |
| **Prevents User Burnout and Rejection:** The HF-Loop is an early warning system that detects when the framework is becoming too cumbersome, allowing for course correction before users become frustrated and abandon it. | - |
| **Creates a Self-Simplifying System:** The pattern creates a formal pressure that forces FPF to evolve towards greater clarity and usability, balancing the drive for formal rigor. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern operationalizes **Didactic Primacy (P-2)**, transforming it from a philosophical statement into an enforceable architectural Standard. The `Rationale Mandate` ensures that every act of formalization is tied to a clear purpose. The `Human-Factor Loop` ensures that the *cost* of using the framework is measured not just in resources, but in the most critical resource of all: the cognitive capacity of its users.

This pattern does not weaken the formal rigor established by other ADRs; it complements it. It guarantees that the powerful machinery of FPF is always directed towards a meaningful, human-relevant goal. It is the constitutional guarantee that FPF will remain, first and foremost, an "Operating System for Thought."

**Relations**

*   **Implements:** Pillar `P-2 Didactic Primacy`.
*   **Complements:** `E.13 Pragmatic Utility & Value Alignment` (which focuses on the relevance of the *problem*, while this pattern focuses on the usability of the *framework*).
*   **Is constrained by:** The overall governance process (DRRs), which is the vehicle for implementing the conceptual simplifications proposed by the HF-Loop.

### Pattern E.13 — Pragmatic Utility & Value Alignment \[A] 

**Context**

The FPF provides a powerful engine for constructing formally correct and highly reliable holons. This power, however, introduces a subtle but profound risk: a team can create a perfectly verified and validated artifact (`AssuranceLevel:L2`) that solves an irrelevant, misunderstood, or non-existent problem. The framework guarantees that the solution is *correct*, but it does not, by itself, guarantee that the solution is *useful*.

Furthermore, many of the most important system objectives—such as "safety," "usability," or "security"—are not directly measurable. They are assessed via **proxy characteristics** (e.g., "number of reported vulnerabilities" as a proxy for security). This practice is vulnerable to Goodhart's Law: when a proxy becomes the primary target, it often ceases to be a good measure of the original goal, as teams begin to optimize the proxy at the expense of the real objective.

**Problem**

Without a formal mechanism to keep the entire assurance apparatus tethered to real-world value, FPF risks enabling two critical failure modes:

1.  **Formalism for Formality's Sake:** Teams become preoccupied with achieving high epistemic scores, producing elegant but useless artifacts. The framework is used to build beautiful solutions to the wrong problems.
2.  **Proxy-Metric Distortion (Goodhart's Law):** Teams successfully optimize for a chosen proxy characteristic, but in doing so, they diverge from—or even actively undermine—the true, often qualitative, `U.Objective` that the proxy was intended to represent. The system becomes technically successful but pragmatically a failure.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Measurability vs. Meaning** | How to use quantitative, measurable proxies for progress without losing sight of the qualitative, often un-measurable, goals that truly matter. |
| **Abstraction vs. Application** | How to build and reason with abstract models without them becoming disconnected from any concrete, practical application. |
| **Incremental Progress vs. Global Value** | How to ensure that local optimizations and incremental improvements are genuinely contributing to the overall value proposition of the holon. |

**Solution**

FPF elevates **Pragmatic Utility (Pillar P-7)** to a normative architectural principle, operationalized through two mandatory conceptual mechanisms.

**1. The Principle of Pragmatic Utility (Expanded Definition)**

Any artifact created within the FPF is an instrument for achieving a specific, pragmatic `U.Objective`. The value of an artifact is determined solely by its **utility** in achieving that objective, not by its epistemic scores in isolation.

**2. Mechanism 1: The Proxy-Audit Loop**

To formally manage the risk of Goodhart's Law, FPF introduces a conceptual feedback loop to periodically review the alignment between proxy characteristics and their intended goals.

*   **New Normative Relation:** A new relation, `isProxyFor: U.Characteristic → U.Objective`, is introduced. This relation **MUST** be used to explicitly declare when a measurable characteristic is serving as a proxy for a higher-level, often qualitative, goal.
*   **Conceptual Audit Process:** Any characteristic marked with the `isProxyFor` relation is subject to a **periodic conceptual audit**.
*   **Review Roles:** This audit is conceptually performed by the individual(s) in the **`Strategist`** role. They are tasked with answering the question: *"Is optimizing for this proxy still reliably driving progress toward the actual `U.Objective` it represents, or have we observed a divergence?"*
*   **Output Concept:** If a divergence is identified, a high-priority `U.Method` for revising or replacing the proxy **MUST** be proposed.

> **Didactic Note for Managers: Are You Climbing the Right Mountain?**
>
> The Proxy-Audit Loop is your compass. Your team's dashboards might show all green—metrics are improving, targets are being hit. But the audit loop forces a crucial question: "Are these the *right* metrics?"
>
> Imagine you are trying to improve "customer satisfaction" (`U.Objective`). You choose "average call handle time" as a proxy metric. Your team successfully drives this number down. But the Proxy-Audit reveals that customer satisfaction is actually *decreasing* because agents are rushing and providing poor service to meet the time target. The loop forces you to recognize this divergence and find a better proxy (e.g., "first-call resolution rate"). It ensures your team is not just climbing fast, but climbing the right mountain.

**3. Mechanism 2: The Minimally Viable Example (MVE) Mandate**

To enforce a pragmatic, value-first approach from the very beginning of a project, any new `U.System` or major system component **MUST** begin its development cycle with the creation of a **Minimally Viable Example (MVE)**.

*   **Definition:** An MVE is a simple, end-to-end, working instance of the holon that demonstrates the achievement of at least one core, user-facing objective, however trivial. It is the FPF equivalent of a "Hello, World" for a complex system.
*   **Assurance Requirement:** The MVE **MUST** achieve a minimum of **`AssuranceLevel:L1 (Substantiated)`**. This means the MVE cannot be a mere mock-up or a purely conceptual sketch; it must be supported by at least one piece of tangible evidence (e.g., a passing test case, a formal assertion), as defined in Pattern B.3.3.
*   **Stege transition Precedence:** The development of the full-scale holon cannot proceed to `AssuranceLevel:L2` until the MVE has been created and has met its L1 requirement.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-E13.1 (Proxy Declaration Mandate):** Any `U.Characteristic` used as a primary driver for an objective **MUST** be explicitly linked to that `U.Objective` via the `isProxyFor` relation.
*   **CC-E13.2 (Proxy-Audit Mandate):** A formal Proxy-Audit review **MUST** be conducted at regular conceptual intervals (e.g., before each major release). The outcome of this review **MUST** be a documented episteme.
*   **CC-E13.3 (MVE Mandate):** The development of any new `U.System` **MUST** be preceded by the creation of an MVE that satisfies the `AssuranceLevel:L1` requirement.
*   **CC-E13.4 (MVE Traceability):** The full-scale `U.System` **MUST** maintain a formal traceability link (`isEvolutionOf`) to its originating MVE.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Perfectly Engineered Irrelevance"** | The team delivers a technically brilliant system that is formally verified and validated, but no one wants to use it because it doesn't solve a real problem. | **CC-E13.3** forces the team to build a working, end-to-end slice of value (the MVE) *first*. This grounds the entire project in a demonstrated solution to a real user need from day one. |
| **The "Metric Myopia"** | The team becomes obsessed with improving a specific KPI, ignoring clear signs that this is not improving—and may even be harming—the overall user experience or business goal. | **CC-E13.2** mandates the Proxy-Audit Loop. This forces a periodic, strategic step-back, where the `Strategist` role is constitutionally required to ask, "Are we still measuring what matters?" |
| **The "Big Design Up Front" Trap** | The team spends months creating a vast, abstract, and highly detailed model of a system before ever building a single working component. | The **MVE Mandate** prevents this. It forces an iterative, pragmatic "build-to-learn" approach, ensuring that models are always grounded in a working reality. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Defense Against Goodhart's Law:** The Proxy-Audit Loop is a concrete, operational defense against the common failure mode of optimizing for the wrong thing. It forces regular, strategic reflection on the meaning of metrics. | **Introduces Strategic Overhead:** The Proxy-Audit Loop and the creation of an MVE require dedicated time for strategic thinking and early implementation. *Mitigation:* This is not an expense but a strategic investment. This upfront effort is designed to prevent the far greater cost of developing the wrong system over months or years. |
| **Ensures Value-Driven Development:** The MVE Mandate guarantees that all major development efforts are grounded in a demonstrated, working solution to a real problem, however small. This prevents teams from investing significant resources in abstract models that have no proven path to practical application. | - |
| **Prevents "Analysis Paralysis":** By requiring an early, working example, this principle encourages an iterative, pragmatic development style. It forces teams to build and learn, rather than over-specifying in a vacuum. | - |
| **Positions FPF as an Engineering Discipline:** This pattern firmly anchors FPF as a tool for practical engineering, not just theoretical modeling. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern operationalizes **Pragmatic Utility (P-7)**. While Pattern E.12 protects the *agent* from the cognitive overload of the framework, this pattern protects the *problem* from being lost in a sea of formal abstraction. It provides the necessary constitutional guardrails to keep the powerful formal methods of FPF focused on delivering tangible, real-world value.

The **MVE Mandate** ensures that every journey starts with a destination in sight. The **Proxy-Audit Loop** ensures that the compass used on that journey remains pointed in the right direction. Together, these mechanisms guarantee that knowledge generated within FPF is not only formally correct and epistemically reliable, but also meaningful, useful, and aligned with its intended purpose.

# **E.14 · Human‑Centric Working‑Model** \[A]

### 1  Intent

Establish a **single, human‑centric Working‑Model** that practitioners can read, discuss, and evolve **without exposure to formal machinery**.  
Each statement **declares a justification stance** (`validationMode`) and, when assurance is sought, attaches **appropriate grounding** via one or more assurance shoulders — **Mapping**, **Logical**, **Constructive** — and **may additionally attach Empirical Validation** (evidence) as defined by the Trust & Assurance calculus. Empirical Validation can accompany any stance; it is **required** when the stance is *postulate*. Assurance shoulders sit **beneath** the Working‑Model and **never define its vocabulary**.
 
+Put bluntly: *one model people work in; three assurance shoulders — plus empirical checks when the world is the judge.*

### 2  Problem & Context

+Teams need **one shared Working‑Model** to make decisions at speed. Historically this surface either:

* **drifts into jargon**—different terms for the same thing, slash‑labels, partial overlaps; or
* **calcifies into machinery**—too formal for day‑to‑day design and review.

Both failure modes create friction between two audiences:
(1) **working users** (engineers, programme managers, policy owners) who need a **small, stable surface**, and
(2) **assurance authors** (ontologists, methodologists, auditors) who need **proofs that the surface is sound**.

E.14 resolves the impasse by **separating concerns**:

* A **Working‑Model layer**: curated kinds and relations expressed in plain terms, governed by simple human rules.
* A **three‑rung Assurance stack** beneath it—**Mapping**, **Logical**, **Constructive**—that carries the heavy arguments (concept alignment, relational semantics, generative traces) and **never leaks back** into the Working‑Model narrative.

This pattern dovetails with the framework’s unification stance (**small Working‑Model surface, rigorous foundations**) and with our constructional mereology commitments (**sum/set/slice** provide extensional identity), while keeping the Kernel minimal and meta‑only.

### 3  Forces

1. **Cognitive economy vs. semantic precision.**
   Managers and engineers must navigate with a handful of names and relations; assurance authors must still certify that those names and relations **are unambiguous and extensional**.

2. **Speed of change vs. guarantees.**
   The Working‑Model must accommodate rapid iteration; the Assurance stack must **lag just enough** to check, without blocking practical progress.

3. **Parsimony vs. expressivity.**
   The Working‑Model should **not proliferate relation types or ad‑hoc categories**; fine‑grained distinctions live in the Assurance layers and are surfaced **only when they materially change a decision**.

4. **Downward grounding vs. upward contamination.**
   Grounding must always flow **down** (Working‑Model → Mapping → Logical → Constructive). No dependence **up** is allowed: proofs and traces never dictate wording or layout in the Working‑Model.

5. **Trans‑disciplinary unification vs. local dialects.**
   The Working‑Model must reconcile different disciplines’ habits **without erasing them**; Mapping captures dialects, while the Working‑Model exposes a **single usable choice**.

6. **Auditability vs. readability.**
   Every Working‑Model statement must be **auditable on request**, yet day‑to‑day views **hide the scaffolding** unless summoned.

### 4  Solution 

#### 4.1 Human-Centric principles

> **E.14‑P.1 – Working‑Model first, stance explicit.**  
> Operate one **Working‑Model** for all human‑facing discussion. For **each** assertion, the author **SHALL declare** a justification stance (`validationMode`) and choose the **appropriate assurance shoulder(s)**: **Mapping** (term↔kind alignment via **Lang‑CHR** / D‑Projection), **Logical** (CT2R alias semantics, scope/constraints), **Constructive** (Γₘ generative trace), and **Empirical Validation** (evidence via `U.EvidenceRole` in a declared `U.BoundedContext`).

> **E.14‑P.2 – Downward‑only dependency.**
> Information **may** flow from the Working‑Model down into any Assurance layer; **no Assurance layer may impose vocabulary or shape back upward** into the Working‑Model.
>
> **E.14‑P.3 – Small surface, big proof.**
> The Working‑Model exposes a **minimal set** of names (L‑1/L‑2 registers) and **a compact family of relations** used in everyday reasoning; precision and completeness are **proved below**.

> **E.14‑P.4 – Human registers first.**
> Terms in the Working‑Model are deliberately curated for **human legibility** (register‑badged, synonym‑aware). Synonym capture and language variance belong to Mapping; **only the chosen canonical label appears on the Working‑Model surface**.

### 5  Layer Standard & Downward Flow (Working‑Model → Assurance)

This section defines **what each layer is for**, **what it guarantees**, and **how a single Working‑Model statement is carried down**.

#### 5.1  Working‑Model (what humans see)

**Purpose.** A small, curated graph of kinds and relations that a mixed team can read at a glance.

**Elements.**

* **Kinds** — one **chosen concept** per node (no slash‑labels).
* **Relations** — a short list intelligible to non‑specialists (e.g., *Component‑of*, *Member‑of*, *Aspect‑of*, plus a small number of cross‑disciplinary ties such as *Interface‑of* or *Constituent‑of*).
* **Language register badges** — terms appearing on the surface are L‑1 or L‑2; L‑3/L‑4 remain in Mapping as synonyms or symbols.

**Obligations.**

* Every Working‑Model edge and node is **grounded downward** (see below).
* The Working‑Model **does not display** constructor jargon, proof terminology, or evidence identifiers; those live in Assurance and are **callable on demand**.

#### 5.2  Assurance‑1: Mapping (from words to kinds)

**Role.** Consolidate human labels from varied sources and **bind them to the chosen kinds** used on the Working‑Model.

**Guarantee.** For any Working‑Model label, there exists a **stable alignment** to exactly one kind; synonyms, abbreviations, locales and registers are recorded here, **not** on the surface. Mapping primarily raises **Typing Assurance (TA)** by consolidating synonyms/registers and binding tokens/labels to **one chosen kind**; calculus‑level metrics live outside Part E.

**Deliverable.** A compact alignment table per scope that makes it obvious which **one label** the Working‑Model will show and which alternatives are tolerated in background sources.

*(Rationale: Working teams speak many dialects; the Working‑Model speaks one. Mapping is the interpreter.)*

#### 5.3  Assurance‑2: Logical (from Working‑Model relations to alias semantics)

**Role.** Give each Working‑Model relation **a precise alias meaning** and **its admissible use‑cases**, keeping the surface vocabulary small.

**Guarantee.** A Working‑Model edge such as *Component‑of* or *Aspect‑of* **carries one intended reading** (transitivity/antisymmetry expectations, scope notes), sufficient for auditors to assess whether the **use is legitimate** in a given context.

**Deliverable.** A short set of alias rules: “When an edge is labeled *Component‑of* at the surface, it intends the structural reading that is later verified by construction.” The Logical layer is **the Standard** that ties human labels to accepted meanings (CT2R alias rules); it primarily contributes **Verification Assurance (VA)**. Calculus‑level symbols are not used in E‑patterns.

*(Rationale: logical aliasing protects the small surface from relation proliferation while keeping meanings crisp.)*

#### 5.4  Assurance‑3: Constructive (from meanings to generative traces)

**Role.** Provide **extensional guarantees** by **constructing** the wholes, collections, and slices that Working‑Model relations speak about.

**Guarantee.** For structural edges, **there exists a constructional narrative** (e.g., *sum*, *set*, *slice*) that, if told, would recreate the whole from its parts or the aspect from its bearer; this makes identity and containment **trackable and testable** across scales.

**Deliverable.** A **single generative story** per structural link (axiomatic justification). For non-structural ties on the surface (e.g., epistemic links), Constructive may be absent; Logical/Empirical take the lead. Constructive contributes **VA** (extensional identity via Γₘ); for **structural** edges, `tv:groundedBy` **MUST** reference exactly one Γₘ trace.

*(Rationale: constructional grounding turns everyday part‑whole talk into statements whose identity conditions are not left to taste.)*

#### 5.5  Assurance‑4: Empirical Validation (from claims to observed world)

**Role.** Record when and where a Working‑Model claim meets reality.  
**Guarantee.** Every empirical binding names a **`U.BoundedContext`**, a **target claim/scope**, and a **timespan**; **staleness/refresh** are managed per context policy.  
**Deliverable.** A `U.EvidenceRole` binding (status‑only) anchored into the Evidence–Provenance chain. Empirical Validation contributes **LA** (raises empirical **R** and constrains **G** to its validated envelope).

#### 5.6  The downward grounding for a single surface statement

Consider a Working‑Model arrow **A –Component‑of→ B**:

1. **Mapping** shows that the words *A* and *B* are the chosen labels for their kinds; it retains tolerated synonyms and symbols in the background.
2. **Logical** confirms that **Component‑of** on the surface means the **structural reading** with its ordinary mereological expectations; if the surface used *Member‑of* instead, Logical would similarly certify the intended reading and its boundaries.
3. **Constructive** exhibits the **constructional narrative** (e.g., a _sum_ of parts resulting in **B** with **A** among them), which yields **axiomatic justification** for the structural edge, sets `validationMode=axiomatic`, and binds the edge via **`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`**.
4. **Empirical Validation** records the **evidence pointer** and scope that make the claim auditable within its `U.BoundedContext` (required for *postulate*; optional reinforcement for other stances).

Together, these three **ground the human arrow without leaking their machinery upward**. The Working‑Model remains simple; the Assurance stack carries the proof.

### 6 · Archetypal Grounding *(System / Episteme)*

> **Tell–Show–Show.** The principle is stated once, then shown on a `U.System` case (structural) and on a `U.Episteme` case (knowledge‑bearing), in line with the authoring template.

**6.1 · `U.System` — Working‑Model first, Constructive grounding available**

* **Publication (Working‑Model).** Authors state structure using familiar relations (e.g., *Impeller* **ut\:ComponentOf** *Pump*; *Pump* **ut\:ComponentOf** *Skid*). Nothing else is required for readers to follow the design.
* **Assurance (downward grounding).** When stronger assurance is sought, the same author **narrates** the constructive story of the whole as a composition of parts and, where appropriate, attaches a downward grounding to that narrative (sum / set / slice). The narrative remains concept‑level and notation‑neutral; order and time stay out of structure and are expressed in their own planes.
* **Canonization move.** Readers continue to see Working‑Model relations as the primary surface; the constructive story is *supporting*, not *defining*.

**6.2 · `U.Episteme` — Working‑Model first; Logical/Mapping preferred; Empirical evidence as appropriate**

* **Publication (Working‑Model).** Authors connect meaning‑bearing artefacts using knowledge relations (e.g., **RepresentationOf**, **UsageOf**) in the same human‑oriented style.
* **Assurance (downward grounding).** Here assurance typically flows to the **Logical** or **Mapping** shoulders (reasoned argument; type/lexical alignment). **Empirical Validation** is used where observation is the right currency (status‑only roles on epistemes); Constructive grounding is optional and used only where a structural interpretation is genuinely intended.
* **Canonization move.** Again, Working‑Model text is the public form; assurance is attached deliberately and separately, without leaking method or time semantics into structure.

**6.3 · Pattern lesson (both cases)**
The **Working‑Model layer remains the canonical publication surface** for authors and reviewers; **assurance layers** (Mapping / Logical / Constructive) are **opt‑in** and used purposefully, with grounding flowing **downwards** from the Working‑Model to the appropriate shoulder. This presentation respects the authoring template’s *Archetypal Grounding* requirement and keeps notational choices illustrative rather than defining.

| **Backwards dependency**          | Letting an assurance artefact redefine public terms.                                        | Preserve **unidirectional dependence**: Working‑Model terms do not derive their meaning from assurance artefacts.                              | Part E guard‑rails (dependency discipline).                          |
| **Silent stance**                 | Publishing claims with no declared assurance stance.                                        | Declare the stance explicitly (e.g., working claim vs reasoned vs constructive).                                                               | Style/authoring discipline in Part E.                                |

> **Reading reminder.** Bias checks are *conceptual* reading aids; they never introduce notational or tooling mandates.

| **CC‑E14‑1 (Working‑Model primacy).**      | Authors **SHALL** publish claims in **Working‑Model** form (human‑oriented **ut:\*Of** relations or equivalent domain statements) as the canonical surface for readers.          | Preserve human‑first canon and didactic clarity.              |
|**CC‑E14‑2 (Downward grounding).** | When assurance is attached, grounding **SHALL** flow **downwards** from the Working‑Model to the appropriate assurance shoulder (**Mapping / Logical / Constructive / Empirical**) and **SHALL NOT** impose vocabulary back onto the Working‑Model. | Maintain plane separation and cognitive economy. |
| **CC‑E14‑3 (Stance declaration).**         | For any claim where assurance matters, the author **SHALL** declare `validationMode` (*postulate / inferential / axiomatic*).                                                    | Make assurance intent explicit and readable.                  |
| **CC‑E14‑4 (No order/time in structure).** | Authors **SHALL NOT** encode execution order, parallelism, or temporal coverage as part–whole; keep them adjacent in their own planes.                                           | Prevent layer leakage and category errors.                    |
| **CC‑E14‑5 (Collection ≠ Composition).**   | Authors **SHALL** keep **membership** claims distinct from **component** claims; no implicit upgrade from collection to assembly.                                                | Guard extensional identity and reader expectations.           |

| **CC‑E14‑7 (Layer direction).**            | Authors **SHALL** avoid back‑defining Working‑Model terms by their assurance artefacts; dependence is one‑way (Working‑Model → Assurance).                                       | Preserve unidirectional dependence of layers.                 |
| **CC‑E14‑8 (Template compliance).**        | Sections **SHALL** follow the canonical pattern order; *Archetypal Grounding* is mandatory for `[A]`.                                                                            | Keep patterns comparable and auditable by reading.            |

|**CC-E14-10 (Structural grounding handshake).** | For **structural** edges on the Working-Model, authors **SHALL** set `validationMode=axiomatic` and provide **Constructive** grounding with `tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice` (see **Compose-CAL** and **CT2R-LOG**). Exactly **one** Γₘ trace is permitted per edge (CI rule alignment). | Aligns E.14 with CT2R-LOG and Compose-CAL; ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC‑E14‑11 (Empirical bindings).**        | When `validationMode=postulate` (or when adding real‑world confirmation), authors **SHALL** bind evidence via `U.EvidenceRole` in a declared `U.BoundedContext` with an explicit **timespan** and provenance anchors. | Aligns with Evidence Graph Referring and empirical ageing policies. |
| **CC-E14-12 (F-declaration).**             | Normative Working-Model artefacts **SHALL** declare `U.Formality = Fk` per **C.2.3** (**recommended F ≥ F3** for readable surfaces). Assurance artefacts **MAY** carry higher F; **min-F** applies to composites. | Aligns E.14 with the unified Formality characteristic; avoids legacy “tiers/modes”. |

*All obligations above are **conceptual** and apply to thought and prose; they introduce no notational or data‑processing requirements.*

**E — Conceptual Examples (no notation, no data handling)**

1. **Assembly from parts → “Component Of”**
   A pump skid is agreed to be nothing over and above its pump, frame, reservoir, and valve set considered together. Because the whole is conceptually *constructed* from those parts, the team may safely speak of each part as *Component Of* the skid. The justification is the construction itself: if any listed part were removed, the very same skid would no longer exist as that whole. This keeps identity extensional and makes the engineer‑facing alias (“Component Of”) truthful rather than conventional.

2. **Parallel elements gathered → “Member Of”**
   A test rig has four identical cartridges used in parallel. The rig treats them as a conceptual *gathering*; membership is fixed by inclusion in that gathering, not by sequence or timing. Speaking of each cartridge as *Member Of* the rig’s cartridge bank is then licensed by the same gathering act. Engineers can keep saying “member,” while architects know the warrant is the underlying construction of the bank as a collection, not an accidental tagging.

3. **Focused facet carved → “Aspect Of”**
   When the team talks about the *thermal envelope* of a reactor, they are not multiplying entities; they are taking the already‑agreed reactor and conceptually *carving out* its thermal facet for focused reasoning. Calling that carve‑out an *Aspect Of* the reactor is justified because the aspect owes its identity to the parent and the chosen facet, and nothing else. This licenses disciplined talk about “boundary,” “interface,” or “envelope” without mistaking them for independent systems.

> **Notes across the examples**
> • Everyday aliases (*Component Of, Member Of, Aspect Of*) remain the only labels engineers need to see; their truth is anchored by prior constructional choices.  
> • Structural links draw on **Constructive** grounding; **epistemic links**—like “Representation Of” or “Usage Of”—may instead rely on **Empirical Validation** (evidence bundles) or **Logical** grounding appropriate to the claim.  

**F — Resulting Context (after you apply the pattern)**

**What improves**

* **Single dial for containment.** Teams can ask one plain question—“what is inside what?”—and trust that all structural talk reduces to shared constructional choices rather than ad‑hoc relation lists. Ontologists keep rigorous warrants without burdening day‑to‑day readers.
* **Extensional identity by default.** Wholes are the wholes they are because of the parts gathered; collections are the collections they are because of their members; aspects inherit identity from their parent and facet. This prevents silent drift when labels change.
* **Layer harmony.** Engineer‑facing aliases live at the same level as other relation names, while their warrants live one step below, keeping human language clean and the generative basis auditable.

**What to watch**

* **Discipline at the structural tier.** A structural link that lacks a constructional warrant is conceptually unsafe. Conversely, forcing epistemic links to pretend they are structural over‑physicalises knowledge claims; for those, evidence or argument is the right currency.
* **Author workload moves, not grows.** Day‑to‑day model authors stay with aliases; specification authors carry the burden of ensuring every structural statement really follows from a sum, a gathering, or a carve‑out. This is a conscious shift of complexity away from operations and into the pattern’s foundation.

**Invariants you must preserve**

* **Parsimony of constructors.** Build wholes by summing parts; build banks by gathering elements; focus facets by carving aspects. Do not invent extra generative acts for parallelism or time‑slicing; those concerns belong to other conceptual services.
* **Two‑tier justification.** Structural talk rides on construction; epistemic talk rides on evidence or proof. Keep the boundary sharp so that later reasoning (about reliability, compliance, or policy) remains clear.

**Known consequences**

* **Stable queries, fewer surprises.** Because aliases are backed by shared constructions, teams from different disciplines can interoperate without renegotiating meanings at hand‑off.
* **Audit trail without jargon.** Reviewers can trace every structural claim to a prior constructional choice, while everyday collaborators keep using familiar relation names.

## 10 · Rationale

**Why Working‑Model is canonical.** FPF privileges **human‑oriented relations** as the primary interface for thinking and communication. This satisfies didactic primacy while preserving conceptual integrity: formal work serves the human layer, not the other way around. The canonical template and style principles institutionalise this choice without inviting notation lock‑in.

**Why grounding flows downward.** Mapping, Logical, Constructive, and Empirical supports are **assurance shoulders** that sit *beneath* the Working‑Model claim. Authors select the shoulder(s) that fit purpose and risk: type/lexical alignment (**TA**), reasoned consequence (**VA**), constructive reconstruction (**VA**), and real‑world confirmation (**LA**). This keeps the Kernel small, avoids plane‑mixing, and provides a clear path to stronger guarantees when warranted.

**Why patterns teach before they tighten.** The Tell‑Show‑Show requirement couples each universal rule with System/Episteme illustrations, reducing cognitive load and preventing premature formalism. It is the didactic mechanism that makes Human‑Centric Canonization practical across disciplines.

**Why no notation talk in Core.** Guard‑rails and the style guide prohibit tool jargon and notation dependence inside normative prose; meanings are given in words and mathematics, with any renderings treated as illustrative only. This preserves longevity and cross‑disciplinary portability.

## 11 · Relations

**Builds on:**

* **E.8 Authoring Conventions & Style Guide** — section order, style principles, and mandatory safety subsections used here.
* **E.7 Archetypal Grounding** — the Tell‑Show‑Show rule applied in this pattern’s own Grounding section.
* **C.2.3 Unified Formality Characteristic (F)** — declares the **F** scale and **ΔF** moves for progressive rigor; Working-Model artefacts **SHALL** declare **F** and remain notation-agnostic.

**Coordinates with.**

* **CT2R‑LOG — Working‑Model Relations & Grounding** — alias rules and `tv:groundedBy` Standard for edges grounded in Γₘ.   
* **Compose‑CAL (Constructional Mereology)** — provides the constructive shoulder (Γₘ: **sum | set | slice**) used to ground structural edges.
* **E.10 Lexical Discipline & Stratification** — ensures naming discipline and register hygiene when the human layer is published.

**Constrains:**

* All `[A]` patterns that publish relations **SHALL** present them in the Working‑Model layer and **MAY** attach assurance only as needed, preserving plane separation and notational independence. (Template conformance as per E.8.)

**Informs.**

* Part F unification practices (context of meaning, bridges, fit levels) by reinforcing the preference for human‑readable labels with explicit alignment notes rather than silent formal substitutions.

# E.15 — Lexical Authoring & Evolution Protocol  (LEX‑AUTH) \[A]

> *Author patterns as evidence‑bearing epistemes, evolve them via governed open‑ended search, and publish an auditable trace that improves quality—not just compliance.*

## 1) Context

FPF patterns are the **canon**: they define the generative rules that other artifacts depend on. Teams need to **change** patterns as the SoTA moves, but ad‑hoc edits lead to drift, weak comparability, and brittle downstream updates. We need a **method** that (a) *generates* better alternatives, (b) *selects* them against explicit quality/assurance targets, and (c) *publishes* a machine‑ and human‑checkable **trace** that can be replayed, audited, and re‑run. (Built to cohere with **DRR (E.9)**, **LEX‑BUNDLE (E.10)**, **Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4)**, **NQD/E‑E (C.18/C.19)**, **Evidence Graph Referring (A.10)**, **Trust (B.3)**, **F‑Suite validation (F.15)**.)

## 2) Problem

Without a disciplined authoring protocol:

* **One‑shot generation** dominates; there is no *evolutionary* path from vN → vN+1.
* “Trace” degenerates into a proof‑of‑work: *a method ran*, not *quality improved*.
* Pattern edits blur **lexicon vs. norms vs. examples**, breaking didactics and tool‑independence.
* SoTA content is cited but not **integrated** via Bridges & CL; claims get over‑ported.

## 3) Forces

| Force                                       | Tension we must resolve                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generativity vs Assurance**               | Open‑ended idea generation must not erode safety/traceability.                    |
| **SoTA speed vs Canon stability**           | Frequent small updates must preserve conceptual integrity and roll‑up invariants. |
| **Local meaning vs Global reuse**           | Context‑local meaning must cross contexts only via **Bridges** with CL penalties. |
| **Notational independence vs Checkability** | Text must stay notation‑free yet be verifiable by Tooling harnesses.              |

## 4) Solution — A *governed evolutionary* authoring method with a publishable **LEX‑AUTH Trace (LAT)**

LEX‑AUTH defines **how** a pattern is **proposed, varied, selected, validated, and merged**, with artifacts and evidence fit to the FPF kernel.

### 4.1 Method (design‑time choreography)

**Stage A — Frame & Scope (Context, Objectives, Invariants)**

1. **Anchor** the work in a **`U.BoundedContext`** for the spec (e.g., `FPF/Core`), cite governing guard‑rails (**E.5.\***), and state **objectives** for the change (e.g., clarity ↑, universality ↑, assurance cost ↓).
2. **Declare the Delta‑Class** (see §4.3) and **impact radius** (dependent patterns, bridges, tests).
3. **Fix acceptance targets** (see §4.4 Quality & SoTA metrics).

**Stage B — Generate candidates (SoTA + NQD)**
4. **Harvest SoTA** inputs (standards, rival patterns, lived domain idioms) and **bind** them as *evidence* via `U.EvidenceRole` with **claim/claim‑scope/timespan** (empirical vs deductive lines).
5. **Generate candidate variants** using **NQD‑CAL** engines (Novelty/Quality/Diversity) with an **E/E policy** (explore↔exploit governor) to populate a **Pareto front** of pattern phrasings/structures. *(No single shot; multiple candidate clauses compete.)*

**Stage C — Shape & Align (Structure, Bridges, USM)**
6. **Shape** top candidates into the standard **\[A] template** (Context → Problem → Forces → Solution → CC → Consequences → Rationale), obeying **LEX‑BUNDLE** (no tooling jargon; twin registers allowed).
7. **Bridge across Contexts** explicitly (F.9): any imported definitions/claims declare **CL** and *loss notes*; propose scoped **narrowing** where needed.
8. **Type scopes** with **USM (A.2.6)**: keep **ClaimScope (G)** distinct from **WorkScope**; no “applicability/envelope” smuggling.

**Stage D — Validate & Decide (Assurance, Tests, DRR)**
9. **Run the harness**: update **SCR/RSCR** (F.15), lint lexical rules (E.10), run **Γ‑consistency** and **RSG/SoD** checks where relevant.
10. **Score** candidates on **Quality & SoTA metrics** (§4.4) and **assurance deltas** (Δ⟨F,G,R⟩).
11. Record a **DRR** (E.9) with *options considered*, *trade‑offs*, chosen candidate, *blast‑radius*.
12. **Merge** the winner; version pattern **SemVer** by Delta‑Class.

**Stage E — Publish & Monitor**
13. Publish the **LEX‑AUTH Trace (LAT)** (§4.2) with the pattern.
14. Schedule **evidence refresh** windows and an **evolution watchpoint** (B.4 loop): when metrics or SoTA inputs decay, reopen Stage B.

### 4.2 The **LEX‑AUTH Trace (LAT)** — what it is and why it matters

A LAT is **not** “we ran a script.” It is a **structured episteme** that lets others **reproduce quality gains** and **re‑run** the search when SoTA shifts.

**LAT minimal contents (publish with the pattern):**

1. **Context & version** (pattern id, context, SemVer, Delta‑Class).
2. **Objective vector** (what we tried to improve: clarity, universality, assurance cost, etc.).
3. **SoTA pack** (sources bound as `U.EvidenceRole` with claim/scope/time and polarity).
4. **NQD settings** (emitters/lenses, diversity characteristics) + **E/E policy** used.
5. **Candidate set** (top K variants with NQD scores + short deltas from baseline).
6. **Bridge ledger** (all cross‑context imports with **CL** and loss notes).
7. **Assurance delta** (Δ⟨F,G,R⟩ from baseline; penalties from CL applied).
8. **Harness results** (checks passed/failed, test diffs).
9. **DRR link** (decision rationale id).
10. **Refresh policy** (evidence decay windows and triggers).

**Uses of the LAT:**
*Reproducibility* (re‑run B‑stages as SoTA changes), *assurance* (explicit impact on F/G/R), *portfolio health* (diversity/coverage), *teaching* (didactic before/after), and *cross‑context safety* (no silent imports).
Publish the pattern with a DRR that carries a LAT pointer (id/URI). The LAT itself is a U.Work evidence pack (non‑normative), archived with edition and Γ_time.

**Example of a LAT‑stub**
```
LAT:
  context: FPF/Core, pattern: F.15, semver: x.y+1, delta-class: Δ‑2
  objectives: {clarity↑, universality↑, assurance-cost↓}
  SoTA-pack: {OpenAlex 2025‑Q3, SPECTER2‑23, DPP‑2019, MAP‑Elites‑2015+}
  NQD-settings: {CharacteristicSpace: domain‑family × …, grid: CVT@k=16}
  candidates: K=4 (wording of RSCR‑F04 & gates)
  bridge-ledger: none (intra‑canon refs only)
  assurance‑delta: ΔF=+, ΔG=+, ΔR=+ (after CL‑penalties=0)
  harness: LEX‑BUNDLE lint pass; F‑suite pass; Γ‑consistency ok
  DRR-id: DRR‑2025‑09‑DFCM‑roll‑in
  refresh: F1‑Card edition refresh window = 6 mo
```

### 4.3 What counts as “changed the pattern as a whole” — **Delta‑Classes & versioning**

Classify the intended change **before** work starts (declared in DRR & LAT):

* **Δ‑0 Lexical polish** — wording/ordering only; **no** change to CC or semantics. → *Patch* (x.y.**z**+1).
* **Δ‑1 Didactic restructure** — narrative/layout; **unchanged** Conformance Checklist (CC). → *Minor* (**x.y**+1.0).
* **Δ‑2 Normative refinement** — CC tightened/clarified; *semantics preserved* by test equivalence. → *Minor* (**x.y**+1.0) + **RSCR** required.
* **Δ‑3 Semantic change** — CC **adds/removes** requirements; downstream contracts shift. → *Major* (**x**+1.0.0) + **impact review** + **bridges refresh**.

> **Definition of “pattern changed as a whole”:** any **Δ‑2/Δ‑3** change (i.e., the **normative surface** or **semantics** changed) counts as a pattern change in the canonical corpus and triggers harness & bridge reviews.

### 4.4 Quality & SoTA metrics (selection lenses)

**Mandatory lenses** (declare in LAT; higher is better unless noted):

* **Clarity** (readability; plain‑register score from didactic rubric).
* **Universality** (C‑1): *≥3 heterogeneous domains* anchored in the Archetypal section.
* **Lexical discipline** (E.10): 0 violations (DevOps lexicon, process/function conflations).
* **Assurance delta**: ΔF (formality), ΔG (scope clarity), ΔR (reliability after CL penalties).
* **Bridge integrity**:  Bridge integrity (policy lens): declare minimum CL thresholds per Context policy; penalties route to R only (B.3/F.9); record policy‑id in LAT.
* **Test conformance**: F‑suite pass; RSCR clean.
* **Exploration health** (NQD): diversity coverage > threshold; no premature convergence.
* **Didactic economy**: length vs density ratio within band; “Tell‑Show‑Show” present.

**Optional lenses** (context‑specific): *Ethical/SoD guard strength; cross‑scale roll‑up integrity; aggregation proofs present;* etc.
## 5) Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑LA‑1 (Context anchoring).**
Every authoring run **MUST** declare a `U.BoundedContext`, Delta‑Class, objectives, and acceptance lenses **before** generating candidates.

**CC‑LA‑2 (SoTA as evidence).**
External inputs **MUST** be bound as `U.EvidenceRole` epistemes with **claim, claim‑scope, polarity, timespan** (formal/empirical lines). No raw links.

**CC‑LA‑3 (Open‑ended generation).**
At least **K≥3** candidate variants **MUST** be generated via **NQD‑CAL** with a declared **E/E policy**; single‑shot edits violate LEX‑AUTH.

**CC‑LA‑4 (Bridges & CL).**
Any cross‑context reuse **MUST** appear in a **Bridge** with **CL** and *loss notes*. CL penalties apply to **R‑lane** when scoring.

**CC‑LA‑5 (Harness).**
The candidate winner **MUST** pass **LEX‑BUNDLE** lint, **SCR/RSCR** tests, Γ‑consistency, and SoD/RSG gates where applicable.

**CC‑LA‑6 (Assurance deltas).**
The LAT **MUST** publish Δ⟨F,G,R⟩ relative to baseline, explicitly accounting for CL penalties and any narrowed scopes.

**CC‑LA‑7 (DRR).**
A **DRR** entry is mandatory for Δ‑2/Δ‑3 changes; it records options considered, rationale, and impact radius.

**CC‑LA‑8 (Refresh plan).**
Empirical evidence in the LAT **MUST** carry a **decay/refresh** window; a watchpoint **MUST** be scheduled in the Canonical Evolution Loop.

**CC‑LA‑9 (Publication).**
Publish the **pattern + LAT** together; past LATs are immutable. New runs produce new LATs.

## 6) Consequences

**Benefits.**
*Evolutive quality*: patterns improve through **search + selection**, not edits by fiat. *Auditability*: a re‑runnable **LAT** shows *why* the chosen variant won. *Safety*: cross‑context reuse is explicit and penalized appropriately. *Comparability*: Δ‑classes & SemVer let downstream readers predict blast‑radius.

**Trade‑offs.**
Some ceremony (LAT/DRR, NQD lenses) and maintenance (evidence refresh, bridge upkeep). These costs buy reproducibility and SoTA tracking.

## 7) Rationale & Links (informative)

LEX‑AUTH extends the FPF constitution by **operationalising pattern evolution**: it plugs **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** into **E.9 DRR**, binds **SoTA** via `U.EvidenceRole` and **KD‑CAL**, drives **candidate generation** with **C.18 NQD‑CAL** under **C.19 E/E‑LOG**, enforces **lexical discipline** via **E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE**, and validates with **F.15** regression harnesses. Cross‑context safety is carried by **F.9 Bridges** with **CL penalties** in **B.3 Trust**. The whole remains **notation‑independent** (E.5.2) and stays within the **Core → Tooling → Pedagogy** dependency rule (E.5.3).

## 8) Operators (authoring deltas you are allowed to apply)

* **Refine** (tighten CC without changing acceptance meaning).
* **Split/Merge** (factor patterns; preserve links; update Bridges).
* **Generalise/Constrain** (expand/restrict ClaimScope (G) with proofs or loss notes).
* **Rephrase** (clarify language; leave CC untouched).

Each operator carries a default **Delta‑Class** and test obligations.

## 9) Self‑application Work Log (how this very pattern was authored)

> *This is **not** chain‑of‑thought; it is the required **`U.Work` evidence** for LEX‑AUTH.*

**Context.** `FPF/Core` (Canon); **Delta‑Class:** Δ‑2 (normative refinement by addition of method & CCs).
**Objectives.** Add an *evolutionary* authoring method; make trace *useful* (quality‑bearing); align with SoTA machinery already in spec.
**SoTA pack (evidence bound).** Prior FPF kernel commitments to **DRR (E.9)**, **E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE**, **B.4 Evolution**, **C.18/C.19** NQD/E‑E, **F.15** harness, **F.9** Bridges, **B.3** Trust; these are treated as the authoritative internal SoTA for the Canon here.
**NQD/E‑E.** Generated ≥3 alternative Solution sections; finalist chosen for clearer Δ‑classes and actionable LAT contents.
**Bridges.** No cross‑external mapping; intra‑canon references only (CL=3).
**Harness.** LEX‑BUNDLE lint (no tooling jargon), CCs unique/atomic, didactic “Tell‑Show‑Show” via Self‑application log, Universality criterion met by cross‑kernel applicability.
**Assurance Δ.** F: + (explicit method & CCs); G: + (scope separation & Δ‑classes); R: + (LAT obligations + bridge penalties).
**DRR.** Recorded: alternatives considered (lighter trace vs full LAT), chosen design (full LAT).
**Refresh.** Reopen when SoTA (e.g., G‑suite authoring kit or CHR templates) evolves or when LAT misuse is seen in reviews.

## E.16 — RoC‑Autonomy: Budget & Enforcement \[A]

**Intent.** Make any claim of autonomous behavior testable and enforceable via a published **AutonomyBudgetDecl**, **Guarded enactment**, **Override SpeechActs with SoD**, and a **Work‑anchored AutonomyLedger**. 
**Rule (summary).** If a Role/Method/Service claims autonomy, authors **MUST**: (i) publish an `AutonomyBudgetDecl` with `AdmissibilityConditionsId` and `OverrideProtocolRef`; (ii) gate Method steps with `requiresAutonomyBudget`; (iii) write a `AutonomyLedgerEntry` on every admitted Work; (iv) block on depletion until a `ResumeAutonomy` SpeechAct passes SoD; (v) surface autonomy fields in UTS rows.

**Builds on:** A.2 / A.2.1 / A.2.5 / A.15; B.3; E.8; E.10; E.11; F.4; F.6; F.15; F.17.
**Coordinates with:** A.13 (Agential Role), C.9 (Agency‑CHR), C.24 (Agent‑Tools‑CAL) where applicable; G.4–G.5–G.8–G.9–G.10 (method authoring/selection/shipping).

### 1) Problem Frame

Autonomy‑claiming **performers** (*RoleAssignments* over services/robots/teams operating without continuous human direction) must **stay within declared limits** (safety, risk, resource, remit) and **yield** to governance when required. Without a uniform rule, “autonomy” drifts into tacit norms, cannot be benchmarked or audited, and undermines selection (Part G) and publication (Part F).

### 2) Problem

* **Opaque autonomy.** Patterns assert “autonomous” behavior with no **budget** or **enforcement**.
* **Un‑gated execution.** Methods can execute beyond authority or risk limits.
* **Ad‑hoc overrides.** No standard **SpeechAct** for pausing/de‑scoping; SoD is unclear.
* **Non‑portable publication.** **UTS (Unified Term Sheet)** rows cannot surface autonomy‑critical data for parity or selection.

### 3) Forces

| Force                          | Tension                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Creativity vs Safety**       | Exploration autonomy vs hard constraints and override duties             |
| **Locality vs Comparability**  | Context‑local rules vs cross‑context selection (G‑suite)                 |
| **Simplicity vs Auditability** | Lightweight authoring vs ledger‑grade evidence                           |
| **Autonomy vs SoD**            | Helpful self‑action vs separation‑of‑duties and human‑in‑the‑loop points |

### 4) Solution — **Rule‑of‑Constraints (RoC) for Autonomy**

This RoC **applies whenever** a Role/Method/Service **claims autonomous operation** (any phrasing that implies unsupervised decision or actuation).

**E.16‑S1 (Autonomy Budget — mandatory).**
Any autonomy claim **MUST** publish an **AutonomyBudgetDecl** as a *named, versioned* object in the **same `U.BoundedContext`**:

```
AutonomyBudgetDecl {
  id, version
  scope: ClaimScope (G)                              // where this budget applies
  budget: {                                          // all typed via MM‑CHR (C.16)
    action_tokens?     : Unitful quota / rate
    decision_tokens?   : Unitful quota / rate
    risk_envelope?     : CHR vector with acceptance bands
    resource_caps?     : set of unitful caps (Γ_work categories)
    time_window?       : Γ_time window & cadence
  }
  AdmissibilityConditionsId : policy-id                          // Aut-Guard policy naming gates & penalties
  overrideProtocolRef : Episteme                     // SpeechAct & SoD for pause/resume/escalate
  telemetrySpecRef? : Episteme                       // what to emit into AutonomyLedger
  editionPins : { RoleRef?, MethodDescRef?, CHR refs, ... } 
}
```

**E.16‑S2 (Guarded enactment — Green‑Gate).**
A **Method step** that *requires* autonomy **MUST** list `requires: [RoleX]` **and** `requiresAutonomyBudget: AutonomyBudgetDecl.id`. A **Work** instance is admissible *iff* at enactment time:

* the performer’s **RoleAssignment** is valid and in an **enactable** RSG state (A.2.5);
* the budget accounting for the **AutonomyBudgetDecl** indicates **tokens/limits remaining** for *this* budget in the declared **Γ_time** window (derived from the AutonomyLedger);
* all **guard checks** defined by `AdmissibilityConditionsId` evaluate to **pass** (e.g., risk ≤ band, resource ≤ cap).

Failing any gate **blocks** enactment (no “soft warnings” on Core surface).

**E.16‑S3 (Autonomy Ledger).**
All admissible Work **MUST** record **AutonomyLedger entries**:

```
AutonomyLedgerEntry {
  workId, performedBy: RoleAssignmentId
  budgetId, version, time
  deltas: { action_tokensΔ?, decision_tokensΔ?, riskΔ?, resourceΔ? }
  guardVerdicts: { name → pass|fail }
  pathIds: { PathId, PathSliceId }                  // for G‑suite parity/refresh
}
```

The ledger is **evidence**: attach to `U.Work` (A.15.1) and fold under **Γ_work** and **Γ_time** for reporting.

**E.16‑S4 (Overrides — SpeechActs & SoD).**
Every budget **MUST** reference an **OverrideProtocolRef** that defines canonical **SpeechActs**:

* **PauseAutonomy(budgetId)** — immediate stop of autonomy‑gated steps;
* **ResumeAutonomy(budgetId)** — resume after conditions;
* **NarrowAutonomy(budgetId, Δscope)** — apply stricter limits;
* **Escalate(budgetId)** — handover to a declared **SupervisorRole**.

**SoD:** The override caller **MUST NOT** be the same **RoleAssignment** that is consuming the budget (enforce `⊥` in the Context). All overrides are **Work** (SpeechActs) with **ledger entries** (zero or negative deltas as per policy).

**E.16‑S5 (Depletion behavior).**
When a budget **depletes** (no tokens / envelope exceeded / cap breached):

* **Block** further autonomy‑gated steps in the **same Γ_time window**;
* Emit **DepletionNotice** (SpeechAct), and either **Escalate** or **Park** per policy;
* Only a **ResumeAutonomy** SpeechAct from an admissible Role (per SoD) may reopen the gate.

**E.16‑S6 (Publication in UTS).**
UTS rows that describe a **Role**, **Method**, **Service**, or **Selector** with autonomy **MUST** include:

* `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef` (id & version);
* `Aut-Guard policy-id`;
* `OverrideProtocolRef`;
* declared **Scope (G)** and **Γ_time** window;
* edition pins for the referenced Role/Method/CHR.
* *(optional, if a scale preference is declared)* `ScaleLensPolicyRef` and `ScaleLensOptIn ∈ {OptedIn, Neutral, OptedOut}`.

**E.16‑S7 (Scale & selection — optional lens).**
When autonomy interacts with open‑ended search (C.18/C.19), **budget consumption** and **guard violations** are **selection lenses** in Part G (G.5/G.9). Applying a **Scale‑Lens / Bitter‑Lesson** preference is **OPTIONAL**. Authors **MAY** declare a **ScaleLensPolicy** for the autonomy claim; when declared, it **MUST** state:
* **Trigger criteria** — evidence that expected utility‑of‑scale is monotonic/non‑saturating on held‑out tasks, and a threshold at which scaling beats structured heuristics.
* **Budget fit** — compute/latency/cost targets **within** the declared `AutonomyBudgetDecl` (Γ_time, resource_caps).
* **Safety invariants** — guards and SoD remain **non‑weakened** under scaling; no policy may bypass E.16 gates.
* **Fallback** — a degrade‑gracefully plan if scaling fails to clear the trigger criteria within budget.
If no **ScaleLensPolicy** is declared, selection remains **neutral** with respect to Bitter‑Lesson; RoC does **not** authorize ignoring scale‑safety guards under any policy.

### 5) Archetypal grounding (Tell‑Show‑Show; human‑centric)

**Show‑A (U.System — mobile robot).**
`Robot_R7#NavigatorRole:Warehouse_2026` executes `Navigate_v3`.
`AutonomyBudgetDecl`: `action_tokens=10 k steps/day`, `risk_bands={maxSpeed ≤ 1.2 m/s, minDist ≥ 0.5 m}`, `resource_caps={battery ≥ 20%}`; `AdmissibilityConditionsId=Aut‑Guard‑R7‑v1`; override via `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `ESCALATE` SpeechActs by `FloorSupervisorRole ⊥ NavigatorRole`. Ledger entries decrement `action_tokens`, track `minDist`. Depletion at 0 tokens halts autonomous moves and pages supervisor.

**Show‑B (U.Service — autonomous deploy).**
`DeployerRole` performs step “Promote to prod” under `AutonomyBudgetDecl` with `decision_tokens=3/day`, `risk_envelope={error‑budget burn ≤ 2% / day}`, guard “all pre‑deploy checks pass”. Overrides only by `CABChair#AuthorizerRole ⊥ DeployerRole`.
→ **Edit:** use `risk_bands` for consistency: `risk_bands={error‑budget burn ≤ 2% / day}`.

### 6) Conformance Checklist (SCR — E.16‑CC)

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **E.16‑CC‑1** | Any autonomy claim **MUST** reference an **AutonomyBudgetDecl** in the same `U.BoundedContext`.                                                                             |
| **E.16‑CC‑2** | **Method steps** that depend on autonomy **MUST** name the `AutonomyBudgetDecl.id` and **MUST** be Green‑Gated by the budget’s guards at enactment.                         |
| **E.16‑CC‑3** | A **Work** admitted under autonomy **MUST** carry an **AutonomyLedgerEntry** with deltas and guard verdicts.                                                                |
| **E.16‑CC‑4** | **Overrides** are **SpeechActs** with SoD enforced (`⊥` between consumer and overrider roles); each override creates a ledger entry.                                        |
| **E.16‑CC‑5** | **Depletion** **MUST** block autonomy‑gated steps until a **ResumeAutonomy** SpeechAct passes SoD and guard checks.                                                         |
| **E.16‑CC‑6** | **UTS rows** for autonomy‑bearing Roles/Methods/Services **MUST** include `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef`, `Aut-Guard policy-id`, `OverrideProtocolRef`, `Scope (G)`, and `Γ_time`. |

### 7) Consequences

* **Testability.** Autonomy is measurable (tokens/envelopes), audit‑ready (ledger), and stoppable (SpeechActs).
* **Comparability.** UTS surfaces autonomy metadata for fair selection & parity.
* **Safety.** Guards are hard gates; depletion halts further autonomy‑gated Work.

### 8) Rationale & E‑/F‑/G‑links

* **E.8** — follows the pattern template (Context → Problem → Forces → Solution → Grounding → CC → Consequences).
* **E.10** — uses LEX‑BUNDLE: Scope via **ClaimScope (G)**, time via **Γ_time**, no “validity/process/actor/agent‑as‑noun” language; new lexical rule **L‑AUTO** added in edits below.
* **E.11 (ATS)** — authoring‑tier gates who may **mint** budgets/guards vs who may **use** them (diff below).
* **Part F** — integrates with **F.4** Role Description (RCS includes *AgencyLevel*; RSG gates), **F.6** Role Assignment & Enactment (Green‑Gate), **F.15** SCR/RSCR (harness includes depletion/override tests), **F.17** UTS (columns, incl. optional ScaleLens fields).
* **Part G** — **G.4/G.5**: method authors must declare budgets & guards; **G.9** parity includes autonomy consumption & violations; **G.10** shipping requires UTS autonomy fields.

## 9) Mini conformance checklist (cross‑E–F; author’s quick use)

1. **Declare** `AutonomyBudgetDecl` (scope, budgets, AdmissibilityConditionsId, overrides).
2. **Gate** steps with `requiresAutonomyBudget`.
3. **Emit** an `AutonomyLedgerEntry` for each admitted Work.
4. **Enforce SoD** on override SpeechActs; **block on depletion**.
5. **Publish** UTS autonomy fields for any autonomy‑bearing Role/Method/Service.

*(These five are sufficient for a working test harness in Part F.)*

## E.17.0 — `U.MultiViewDescribing — Viewpoints, Views & Correspondences` \[A]

> **Tech‑name:** `U.MultiViewDescribing`
> **Plain‑name:** multi‑view describing (viewpoints, views, correspondence for families of descriptions/specifications)

**Status & placement.** Part E (Describing & Publication). Normative architectural pattern.
**Builds on:** C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (DescribedEntity/Viewpoint/View slots), A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`, A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`, A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`, A.7 (Strict Distinction; I/D/S vs Surface), E.10.D1 (Context), E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline).
**Used by:** E.17 (MVPK — publication as a specialisation of multi‑view describing for morphisms), E.17.1 `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`, E.17.2 `TEVB`, E.18.S12 (E.TGA engineering viewpoint families), domain‑specific description schemes (architecture, safety cases, governance, research). 

**Guard (lexical).**

* `U.Viewpoint` is the ValueKind of `ViewpointSlot` and denotes **intensional viewpoint specs**, not surfaces or carriers. 
* `U.View` is an alias of `U.EpistemeView`, i.e. an **episteme‑level view**, not a document or file. Views are epistemes; Surfaces are carriers in L‑SURF.
* `ViewFamilyId` is a lexical tag for **families of viewpoints** (e.g. TEVB), never for view kinds, MVPK `U.View`/`U.ViewFamily(·)` bundles or Surface kinds. MVPK face kinds remain `{PlainView, TechCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane}`. 

### 1 · Problem frame  *(informative)*

Complex systems (social‑technical, cyber‑physical, organisational) are routinely described from **many perspectives**:

* functional vs structural vs deployment vs behavioural views,
* safety vs performance vs cost vs governance views,
* formal specs vs operational runbooks vs regulatory dossiers.

Post‑2015 MBSE and architecture practice emphasise **viewpoints and views** (ISO 42010, SysML v2), and contemporary model‑based toolchains treat views as **queries or projections over shared models** rather than independent documents.

In FPF terms:

* the things we talk about — systems, methods, services, epistemes — are `U.Entity`/`U.Holon` values in `DescribedEntitySlot`; 
* descriptions and specifications of those things are `U.Episteme` instances (`…Description` / `…Spec`) with a **DescriptionContext** = `⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`; 
* episteme‑level views are `U.View` (`U.EpistemeView`) that slice ClaimGraphs under specific viewpoints and representation schemes. 

What we lack without this pattern is a **universal way to organise families of descriptions/specifications under multiple viewpoints** — for any entity‑of‑interest, not only for architecture, and without collapsing “view” into “document” or “diagram”.

### 2 · Problem  *(informative, but sharp)*

Without `U.MultiViewDescribing`:

1. **Viewpoints, views, and surfaces collapse.**
   In practice, “architecture view”, “diagram”, “spec”, and “published deck” are used interchangeably. This:

   * confuses *episteme* (`U.View`) with *carrier* (`U.Surface`),
   * hides which **concerns and stakeholders** a description is written for,
   * makes it impossible to check whether a given description family is “complete enough” for a chosen viewpoint library.

2. **Descriptions float without viewpoints.**
   Legacy I/D/S discipline distinguishes Intension vs Description vs Spec, but does not, on its own, forbid “view‑from‑nowhere” descriptions (no declared viewpoint). That contradicts the pragmatic stance encoded in C.2.1: **no episteme without concerns**.

3. **Each domain reinvents multi‑view semantics.**
   Architecture, safety cases, governance frameworks, and research workflows all use local notions of “view”, “viewpoint”, and “consistency between views”. Without a shared pattern:

   * E.TGA, MVPK, and discipline packs introduce their own “view” laws, duplicating work;
   * cross‑domain reasoning (e.g. mapping a safety view to an architecture view) becomes ad‑hoc;
   * we cannot give a single formal story for consistency, correspondence, and EpistemicViewing across families of descriptions.

4. **No place to attach correspondence.**
   ISO 42010‑style *correspondences* and modern BX/consistency relations have nowhere canonical to live. We need a **CorrespondenceModel over families of D/S epistemes** that integrates with `U.EpistemicViewing`/`U.EpistemicRetargeting` and C.2.1’s slot graph.

### 3 · Forces  *(informative)*

| Force                                  | Tension                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs domain idioms**      | One pattern should handle engineering, safety, governance, research, etc. ↔ domain communities expect their own jargon (architecture description, safety case, dossier…).              |
| **Viewpoint locality vs reuse**        | Viewpoints must be local to families of descriptions (`EoIClass`, Context) ↔ we want reusable **viewpoint bundles** (libraries) across projects and domains.                           |
| **I/D/S strictness vs pragmatics**     | Intension ≠ Episteme; D/S are epistemes with DescriptionContext ↔ engineers think in “views over a system”, not in pure I/D/S algebra.                                                 |
| **Slot discipline vs approachability** | C.2.1/A.6.5 give a clean SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline ↔ authors want to talk about “functional view” and “safety view” without carrying all slot jargon in didactic material. |
| **Epistemic vs surface layers**        | Views (epistemes) must be clearly separated from PublicationSurface and carriers ↔ authors often conflate “viewpoint”, “view”, and “document”.                                         |
| **Consistency vs incremental change**  | We want strong correspondence between views ↔ views evolve asynchronously; partial inconsistency must be representable and repairable (BX‑style).                                      |

### 4 · Solution — `U.MultiViewDescribing` as the universal multi‑view scaffold  *(normative core)*

#### 4.1 · Overview

`U.MultiViewDescribing` organises **families of descriptions/specifications** for a shared entity‑of‑interest into a multi‑view structure with:

* **explicit viewpoints** (`U.Viewpoint`) as intensional specs of stakeholders, concerns, allowed D/S kinds, and conformance rules; 
* **episteme‑level views** (`U.View = U.EpistemeView`) as view‑epistemes over those descriptions/specs; 
* a **CorrespondenceModel** capturing correspondences between D/S and their views across viewpoints.

The pattern is **parameterised by a class of described entities**:

> **Parameter:** `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` — the class of entities‑of‑interest
> (typical species: `U.Holon` for engineering holons, `U.Morphism` for morphism publication, `U.Episteme` for meta‑describing epistemes).

All members of a `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` family share:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` value in that `EoIClass`, and
* a `BoundedContextRef` (E.10.D1) forming a **DescriptionScope** together with the entity. 

Informally:

* Fix an entity `T ∈ EoIClass` and a bounded context `C`.
* The **multi‑view family** for `<T,C>` consists of a set of `…Description` / `…Spec` epistemes, each under a declared viewpoint, plus their `U.View` views, together with a correspondence model relating them.

#### 4.2 · Core constructs

##### 4.2.1 `EoIClass` and DescriptionScope

1. **EoIClass.**
   A `U.MultiViewDescribing` instance declares an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` that acts as a **species‑level constraint** on the ValueKind of `DescribedEntitySlot`.

   * In engineering species (TEVB) this is typically `U.Holon` restricted to `U.System` or `U.Episteme`. 
   * In MVPK, `EoIClass = U.Morphism`. 

2. **DescriptionScope (informal).**
   For a fixed `T ∈ EoIClass` and `C : U.BoundedContext`, the **DescriptionScope** `Scope(T,C)` is the notional scope under which:

   * all descriptions/specifications have `DescribedEntityRef = T` and `BoundedContextRef = C` in their DescriptionContext; 
   * all views (`U.View`) attached to this family preserve that `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef` (for D/S views).

   Formal USM treatment of `U.DescriptionScope` is fixed in E.10/L‑SURF; here we only rely on the intuition “**we are describing this thing, in this context**”.

##### 4.2.2 `U.Viewpoint` (intensional viewpoint spec)

`U.Viewpoint` is already introduced in C.2.1 as the ValueKind of `ViewpointSlot`; E.17.0 fixes its **internal structure** for describing families. 

**Definition (normative, intensional).**
A `U.Viewpoint` is an intensional specification:

* `EoIClassSpec ⊑ U.Entity` — the class of entities this viewpoint is defined for (must be compatible with the family’s `EoIClass`);
* `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(U.RoleEnactor)` — stakeholder / RoleEnactor families the viewpoint speaks for (e.g. “safety engineers”, “operations teams”).
* `Concerns : FinSet(U.Concern)` — concern set (qualities, risks, obligations) that matter under this viewpoint.
* `AllowedEpistemeKinds : FinSet(U.EpistemeKindId)` — which D/S episteme kinds are admissible as **primary descriptions** and as **derived views** under this viewpoint (e.g. system‑level behaviour description, test harness spec, safety case, CG‑Spec slice).
* `ConformanceRules` — a structured bundle of rules/tests describing when a D/S episteme or view **conforms** to the viewpoint, including:

  * minimal content requirements (e.g. “must cover all safety‑critical functions”),
  * admissible `U.EpistemicViewing` pipelines to derive views from base descriptions,
  * allowed degrees of incompleteness and evidence requirements (link to E.11/ATS and Part F harnesses).

**Slot alignment.**

* `ViewpointSlot` has ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`, RefKind `U.ViewpointRef`; episteme fields are named `viewpointRef : U.ViewpointRef?`. 
* For D/S epistemes in a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family, `viewpointRef` is **mandatory** as part of `DescriptionContext`.

##### 4.2.3 `U.View` (episteme‑level views)

`U.View` is an alias for `U.EpistemeView`, a species of `U.Episteme` whose kind includes:

* `ClaimGraphSlot` (often a sliced or projected ClaimGraph),
* `DescribedEntitySlot`,
* `ViewpointSlot`,
* `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (and usually a `RepresentationSchemeSlot` in C.2.1+).

Normatively:

* A `U.View` in `U.MultiViewDescribing` is obtained via a `U.EpistemicViewing` morphism from some base D/S episteme in the family (see 4.3). It **shares the same `describedEntityRef`** and usually the same `BoundedContextRef`.
* `ViewSlot` is reserved for **references to such views** in meta‑structures (e.g. correspondence models, MVPK view families), never for carriers.

##### 4.2.4 `U.CorrespondenceModel` (view–view correspondence)

`U.CorrespondenceModel` is an episteme (typically a `U.EpistemeCard`) whose ClaimGraph expresses **correspondence relations between D/S epistemes and/or views** within a DescriptionScope:

* cross‑viewpoint correspondences (e.g. “this safety requirement is realised by this design element”),
* structural/behavioural consistency conditions (BX‑style consistency relations),
* change‑impact links (which views must be revisited when some view changes).

`CorrespondenceModel` is **used, but not defined, by A.6.3**: species of `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` reference it when computing views that depend on multiple epistemes or representation regimes.

### 4.3 · Multi‑view families and their laws (MVD‑0…MVD‑7)  *(normative)*

We now fix the laws that any `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` instance must satisfy.

#### MVD‑0 · Family objects

For a fixed `EoIClass` and bounded context `C`, a **multi‑view family** for an entity `T ∈ EoIClass` consists of:

* a (finite) set `D_S(T,C)` of D/S epistemes such that for each `E ∈ D_S(T,C)`:

  * `E : U.Episteme` of some kind in `AllowedEpistemeKinds` of its viewpoint,
  * `subjectRef(E)` decodes to `DescriptionContext(E) = ⟨DescribedEntityRef = T, BoundedContextRef = C, ViewpointRef(E)⟩`,
  * `viewpointRef(E)` lies in the family’s viewpoint set `Σ ⊆ FinSet(U.Viewpoint)`;
* a set `Views(T,C) ⊆ U.View` of view‑epistemes over those D/S epistemes, obtained by declared `U.EpistemicViewing` species (see MVD‑3);
* zero or more `U.CorrespondenceModel` epistemes over `{D_S(T,C), Views(T,C)}`.

Families are **scoped**: the same entity in a different `U.BoundedContext` belongs to a different family.

#### MVD‑1 · Viewpoint locality and totality for D/S

For any multi‑view family:

1. **Viewpoint‑totality for D/S.**
   Each D/S episteme in `D_S(T,C)` **MUST** have a `viewpointRef` either:

   * explicitly populated, or
   * deterministically derived from a `U.ViewpointBundle` the family declares (see E.17.1).

   There are no “viewpoint‑free” D/S epistemes inside a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family.

2. **Viewpoint locality.**
   `ViewpointRef` values for `D_S(T,C)` must belong to a **finite viewpoint set `Σ`** declared for the family (locally or via a bundle). Cross‑family reuse happens **via bundles and Bridges**, not by silently sharing viewpoints across unrelated scopes.

3. **DescriptionContext alignment.**
   `DescriptionContext(E)` for any D/S episteme in the family must use the **same `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef`** as the family; any change of described entity or context is **outside this family** and must be expressed via `U.EpistemicRetargeting` and/or Context Bridges.

#### MVD‑2 · Views are EpistemicViewing results

For any `V ∈ Views(T,C)`:

1. There exists a base episteme `E ∈ D_S(T,C)` and a morphism `v : E → V` such that:

   * `v` is a species of `U.EpistemicViewing`, i.e. an **effect‑free, describedEntity‑preserving** episteme morphism;
   * `describedEntityRef(V) = describedEntityRef(E) = T`,
   * `BoundedContextRef(V) = BoundedContextRef(E) = C`,
   * `viewpointRef(V)` is either:

     * the same as `viewpointRef(E)` (internal normalisation), or
     * a viewpoint in the same family `Σ`, with the change recorded in the family’s `CorrespondenceModel` (see MVD‑4).

2. No view may be introduced “out of thin air”: every `U.View` in the family is traceable to at least one D/S episteme (or a finite diagram thereof) via a **documented EpistemicViewing pipeline**.

3. Views **do not introduce new intensional commitments** about `T` beyond what is licensed by EFEM & EpistemicViewing laws (no new atomic claims about the same described entity). Strengthening Intension requires new D/S under A.7/E.10.D2, not a view.

#### MVD‑3 · Applicability profiles for viewings

Any EpistemicViewing species used inside `U.MultiViewDescribing` **MUST**:

* declare an Applicability profile as per EV‑6: permitted `EoIClass`, grounding, viewpoint ranges, and representation schemes; 
* for D/S epistemes in a family:

  * **preserve** `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef` of `DescriptionContext`,
  * either preserve `ViewpointRef` or change it **within the family’s viewpoint bundle**, with constraints recorded in `CorrespondenceModel`,
  * never widen ClaimScope beyond EFEM/EpistemicViewing allowances.

Any change of described entity (even “small”, e.g. subsystem→system) must be expressed via `U.EpistemicRetargeting` and is **not** a MultiViewDescribing view refinement.

#### MVD‑4 · CorrespondenceModel as the home of cross‑view correspondences

When views or D/S epistemes under different viewpoints are meant to be **kept in correspondence** (in ISO 42010 or BX sense), the family **SHALL**:

1. Provide a `U.CorrespondenceModel` episteme whose `ClaimGraph` captures correspondences and consistency relations over `{D_S(T,C), Views(T,C)}`.

2. Ensure that any `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` that depends on multiple epistemes or representation schemes:

   * references that `CorrespondenceModel`, and
   * publishes witnesses (proof objects, trace links) that make diagrams commute up to declared isomorphism (oplax naturality allowed).

3. Treat temporary inconsistency explicitly: there may be states where some correspondences are violated; this is represented as **facts in the correspondence ClaimGraph**, not as hidden weakening of viewing laws.

#### MVD‑5 · Separation from publication (MVPK)

`U.MultiViewDescribing` is purely **epistemic**:

* D/S epistemes and views live entirely in Ep‑space (`U.Episteme`);
* it does **not** define PublicationSurface, carriers or rendering;
* MVPK (E.17) sits **on top**:

  * taking morphisms and/or D/S epistemes as input,
  * using `U.EpistemicViewing` plus publication‑specific viewpoints,
  * emitting `U.View` instances that then get attached to Surfaces via L‑SURF.

MultiViewDescribing therefore **does not re‑define I→D/D→S** (`Describe_ID`, `Specify_DS`) and does not introduce any Work on carriers; those remain in A.7/E.10.D2 and E.17.

#### MVD‑6 · I/D/S alignment

For any `U.MultiViewDescribing` instance:

1. Every `…Description` and `…Spec` episteme in the family must satisfy E.10.D2:

   * be an episteme with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,
   * be linked to a unique Intension via `isDescriptionOf` / `isSpecOf` with the additional `ViewpointRef` parameter.

2. Viewings and correspondence operations **must not**:

   * collapse Intension into episteme,
   * confuse D/S with publication surfaces,
   * reinterpret described entity without going through A.6.4 retargeting.

#### MVD‑7 · Slot discipline

All constructs in this pattern **SHALL** respect `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`:

* SlotKinds (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and their ValueKinds/RefKinds follow A.6.5 and C.2.1.
* `*Slot` suffix is reserved for SlotKinds; `*Ref` for RefKinds/fields, never for Kinds or objects. 
* MultiViewDescribing patterns **must not** invent parallel slot disciplines for “roles in relations”; they reuse SlotKind as the notion of position.

### 5 · Archetypal grounding  *(informative)*

1. **Engineering holon (TEVB).** 
   * `EoIClass = U.Holon` (restricted to `U.System`/`U.Episteme`).
   * TEVB (E.17.2) supplies a viewpoint bundle with canonical engineering viewpoints: Functional, Structural, Role‑Enactor, Module‑Interface, etc.
   * For a particular system `S` in context `C`, D/S epistemes include functional descriptions, structural designs, role‑enactment models, and interface specs.
   * Views derived via EpistemicViewing include sliced safety views, performance‑focused views, and minimal runbooks.
   * `CorrespondenceModel` records how functional elements are realised structurally, where hazards map to components, etc.

2. **Morphism publication (MVPK).**
   * `EoIClass = U.Morphism`.
   * D/S epistemes capture the semantic characterisation of morphisms (pre‑/post‑conditions, CG‑Specs, CHR pins).
   * Viewpoints are publication‑oriented (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`); views are MVPK faces over those morphisms.
   * CorrespondenceModel states how the same morphism appears as a simple narrative, a typed card with units, an interoperability card, and an assurance lane with evidence bindings — all without new claims.

3. **Safety case vs architecture vs operations.**
   * `EoIClass = U.Holon`.
   * Viewpoints: SafetyCase, Architecture, Operations.
   * Families tie together safety requirements, architectural structures, and operational procedures for the same plant `P` in context `C`.
   * Views: a safety‑focused slice of the architecture description, an operational runbook annotated with safety invariants, etc.
   * CorrespondenceModel expresses coverage and consistency between these views, enabling BX‑style repair when one side changes.

### 6 · Conformance checklist (author’s quick use)  *(normative)*

When defining a new `U.MultiViewDescribing` species or using it in a discipline pack:

1. **Declare the EoIClass.**
   *Explicitly state `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` and ensure all families restrict `DescribedEntitySlot` accordingly.*

2. **Define the viewpoint set Σ.**
   *List `U.Viewpoint` instances (possibly via a `U.ViewpointBundle`) with stakeholders, concerns, allowed EpistemeKinds, and conformance rules.*

3. **Require DescriptionContext for D/S.**
   *Ensure every `…Description`/`…Spec` episteme in the family has `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` and that `ViewpointRef ∈ Σ`.*

4. **Specify admissible EpistemicViewing species.**
   *List the `U.EpistemicViewing` profiles used to derive views; declare their Applicability profiles and assert they are describedEntity‑preserving (EV‑6).*

5. **Attach CorrespondenceModel where needed.**
   *Whenever cross‑view consistency matters, introduce a `U.CorrespondenceModel` episteme and reference it from any `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing`.*

6. **Separate describing from publication.**
   *Check that pattern text does not treat I→D/D→S as “publication”, and that any talk of Surfaces/carriers is clearly delegated to MVPK/L‑SURF.*

7. **Respect SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.**
   *Use `*Slot` only for SlotKinds, `*Ref` only for RefKinds/fields; avoid `Subject`/`Object` roots in episteme types; use `DescribedEntitySlot` and `viewpointRef` instead.*

### 7 · Consequences  *(informative)*

* **Unified multi‑view story across domains.**
  Engineering descriptions, safety cases, governance dossiers, research artefacts — all become instances of the same multi‑view pattern, enabling coherent tooling and education.

* **Explicit, testable viewpoints.**
  Viewpoints move from vague labels (“architecture view”) to first‑class objects (`U.Viewpoint`) with stakeholder families, concerns, allowed D/S kinds, and conformance rules. This allows ATS‑style checks and better review practices.

* **Views as disciplined projections, not new documents.**
  `U.View` is an episteme generated by viewings, not a free‑floating PowerPoint. This constrains what tools are allowed to do when “generating views”, and prevents silent strengthening of commitments.

* **Correspondence as a first‑class citizen.**
  Consistency and traceability between views are expressed via ClaimGraphs in `U.CorrespondenceModel`, not as scattered hyperlinks or spreadsheet columns.

* **Clean separation of describing vs publishing.**
  `U.MultiViewDescribing` ends the long‑standing conflation between describing (I→D→S) and publication (D/S→Surface). MVPK becomes a clean specialisation on top, not a second I/D/S discipline.

* **Slot‑level interoperability.**
  C.2.1/A.6.5 slot discipline applies uniformly; new domains can introduce viewpoint bundles and multi‑view families without inventing new ontologies for “view positions” or “roles in relations”.

### 8 · Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*

* **ISO 42010 and viewpoint libraries.**
  ISO 42010 distinguished *viewpoints* (stakeholders + concerns + conventions) from *views* (descriptions under those viewpoints) and introduced viewpoint libraries. `U.MultiViewDescribing` generalises this beyond “architecture descriptions” to **any descriptions/specifications**, with `EoIClass` parameter and explicit viewpoint bundles used by TEVB and MVPK. 

* **MBSE & SysML v2 views‑as‑queries.**
  Modern MBSE treats views as **queries over shared models** with controlled rendering. That aligns with `U.EpistemicViewing` as a pure, describedEntity‑preserving morphism, and with `U.View` as an episteme view derived from D/S under a viewpoint.

* **BX / model synchronisation.**
  Bidirectional transformations literature treats consistency relations and repair as first‑class. `U.CorrespondenceModel` and `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` provide an FPF‑native home for such relations, ensuring that consistency rules live in ClaimGraphs and respect episteme morphism laws, rather than being buried in tool code. 

* **Optics and displayed categories.**
  With C.2.1 and A.6.3, epistemes form a category fibred over described entities; viewings act like optics over the episteme slot graph. `U.MultiViewDescribing` is the **displayed‑category‑like** organisation of families indexed by `DescribedEntitySlot` and `ViewpointSlot`, making later categorical reasoning (e.g. structured cospans for view composition) straightforward.

* **Hybrid symbolic/latent representations.**
  By treating `U.RepresentationScheme` and `U.RepresentationOperation` as episteme components, families can mix symbolic specs, diagrams, code, and latent representations (e.g. LLM‑based summaries) while staying within the same multi‑view discipline and EpistemicViewing laws.

### 9 · Relations  *(informative summary)*

* **Builds on C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.**
  Uses `DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot` as the structural backbone for descriptions, views, and correspondence.

* **Builds on A.6.2–A.6.4.**
  Families rely on `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` for view‑producing morphisms, `U.EpistemicViewing` for describedEntity‑preserving views, and `U.EpistemicRetargeting` for moves that change the described entity (outside a given family).

* **Constrains E.17 (MVPK).**
  MVPK is a **publication‑specialised MultiViewDescribing for morphisms**: its viewpoints are publication viewpoints; its ViewFamily is a special case of `Views(T,C)` with `T` a morphism; its laws must respect MVD‑0…MVD‑7.

* **Constrains E.17.1 / E.17.2.**
  `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` and TEVB provide concrete viewpoint bundles populating `Σ` for particular `EoIClass` (e.g. engineering holons), but they must treat viewpoints as `U.Viewpoint` values in `ViewpointSlot`, not as ad‑hoc tags. 

* **Coordinates with E.10.D2 (I/D/S) and E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE.**
  Ensures every D/S episteme in a family has a DescriptionContext, keeps “Describe/Specify” distinct from “Publish”, and respects lexical guards around `View`, `Viewpoint`, `Surface`, `ViewFamilyId`, `*Slot`, `*Ref`.

* **Coordinates with B.5.* / F‑cluster.**
  Viewpoints’ stakeholder families and concerns link naturally with RoleEnactment (B.5.*) and Part F role descriptions, assignments, harnesses — without overloading `U.Role` as a coordinate in I/D/S or episteme slots.

## E.17.1 — `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary — Reusable Viewpoint Bundles` \[A]

> **Tech‑name:** `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`
> **Plain‑name:** viewpoint bundle library (reusable viewpoint families)

**Status & placement.** Part E (Describing & Publication). Normative architectural pattern.

**Builds on:**
A.6.2–A.6.4 (Episteme morphism classes),
A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline),
A.7 (Strict Distinction; I/D/S vs Surface),
E.7 (Archetypal Grounding),
E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE, especially naming discipline for `ViewFamilyId`),
E.10.D1/D2 (Context and I/D/S discipline),
E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`.

**Used by:**
E.17.2 (TEVB — Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle),
E.18.S12 (E.TGA engineering viewpoint families),
future domain‑specific viewpoint packs (architecture, governance, safety, research).

**Guard (lexical & ontological).**

* A **viewpoint bundle** is a family of `U.Viewpoint` values (intensional specs) plus metadata; it is **not** a collection of `U.View`, `PublicationSurface`, or files.
* `ViewFamilyId` is a lexical tag that names a **viewpoint family** (bundle), never:
  * a `U.View` kind,
  * an MVPK face/surface kind,
  * nor a file/folder label in L‑SURF.
* `EngineeringVPId` / `PublicationVPId` remain separate (E.18.S12, E.17); E.17.1 does **not** collapse engineering and publication viewpoints into one id.
* Bundles are **intensional catalogue objects**: they specify reusable viewpoint families that `U.MultiViewDescribing` instances may import; they do not define new episteme kinds or surface kinds.

### 1 · Problem frame  *(informative)*

`U.MultiViewDescribing` organises descriptions/specifications of an entity‑of‑interest into multi‑view families with explicit viewpoints and correspondence. In practice:
* engineering teams talk about “functional / procedural / structural / module‑interface” views of a system;
* governance teams talk about “risk / compliance / operations” views of a service;
* research teams talk about “theory / experiment / inference / limitations” views of a method.

Across organisations and projects, these **viewpoint families repeat** with only minor variations. ISO 42010 already recognises *viewpoint libraries* as a way to capture such recurring families for architecture descriptions; MBSE stacks and SysML v2 profiles do the same for model views.

FPF needs a **uniform way to define and reuse such viewpoint families**:
* so that `U.MultiViewDescribing` can import them instead of redefining Σ from scratch;
* so that E.TGA and MVPK can refer to the same engineering viewpoint families via stable ids;
* so that authoring guidance (E.8/E.12) and lexical discipline (E.10) can attach to named families rather than ad‑hoc sets.

### 2 · Problem  *(informative)*

Without a dedicated pattern for viewpoint bundle libraries:

1. **Each domain bakes its own “viewpoint sets”.**
   E.TGA, MVPK, safety‑case disciplines, and governance packs tend to introduce local notions such as “engineering views”, “assurance views”, “governance decks” without a shared representation. Viewpoints drift, and cross‑domain mapping becomes opaque.

2. **Viewpoint identity is unstable.**
   A team may call something “functional view” in one project and “capability view” in another, even though the underlying concerns, stakeholders, and conformance rules are identical. The same `U.Viewpoint` is re‑invented and slightly renamed, making long‑term consistency and automation harder.

3. **MultiViewDescribing cannot easily reuse families.**
   `U.MultiViewDescribing` allows an arbitrary finite set of viewpoints Σ for each `<T,C>` (entity, context). Without a standard way to say “Σ is the TEVB engineering family” or “Σ is the governance‑risk bundle”, each family has to list viewpoints explicitly and locally.

4. **ISO 42010 viewpoint libraries remain external.**
   There is no canonical place in FPF where ISO‑style viewpoint libraries (for architecture descriptions) can be represented as first‑class objects and aligned with FPF’s `U.Viewpoint`, I/D/S discipline, and episteme morphisms.

5. **Lexical aliases leak into semantics.**
   Names like “Functional”, “SafetyCase”, or “Regulatory” may be used both as:

   * intensional viewpoint specs; and
   * ad‑hoc labels on documents, files or MVPK faces.
     Without a clear lexical discipline, this causes confusion about what exactly is being reused.

E.17.1 addresses these issues by introducing `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` as the place where **reusable viewpoint families** are defined, named, and versioned.

| **Reuse vs local fit**                    | Organisations want shared viewpoint families (engineering, safety, governance) ↔ projects need to tweak or subset them for specific contexts and maturity levels.             |
| **Domain idioms vs neutral core**         | Domains carry their own jargon (architecture, safety case, regulatory dossier) ↔ FPF needs a neutral `U.Viewpoint` core to support cross‑domain reasoning and tooling.        |
| **Stability vs evolution**                | Viewpoint families must be stable enough to support long‑term automation and training ↔ they must evolve as practices and standards evolve.                                   |
| **Intensional vs artefact layers**        | Viewpoint families talk about concerns and conformance rules ↔ teams routinely attach the same name to concrete documents or MVPK faces.                                      |
| **Engineering vs publication viewpoints** | Engineering viewpoints govern how a holon is described ↔ publication viewpoints govern how those descriptions are exposed as surfaces; we need both, without collapsing them. |
| **Library size vs cognitive load**        | Rich libraries with many viewpoint families increase flexibility ↔ authors must still be able to choose and understand a small subset in each project.                        |

### 4 · Solution — `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`  *(normative core)*

#### 4.1 · Overview

`U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` is the **architectural home for reusable viewpoint families**.

* A **viewpoint library** is a collection of **viewpoint bundles**; each bundle names and packages a finite family of `U.Viewpoint` values that are intended to be reused together.
* Each **viewpoint bundle**:

  * is identified by a `ViewFamilyId` lexical tag;
  * constrains an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` for which its viewpoints are valid;
  * enumerates a finite set Σ of `U.Viewpoint` definitions;
  * may carry archetypal grounding cards (E.7) and alignment notes (e.g., ISO 42010 mappings).

`U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` then uses such bundles as **providers of Σ** for families of descriptions/specifications:

* for a fixed entity `T ∈ EoIClass` and bounded context `C`, a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family may declare:

  * that its viewpoint set Σ is **imported from** a specific `ViewFamilyId`, possibly with a finite subset selection; or
  * that Σ is locally defined (no bundle) — still allowed, but less reusable.

TEVB (E.17.2) and E.TGA S12 are species of this pattern for engineering holons.

#### 4.2 · Core constructs

##### 4.2.1 `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` (library object)

**Tech:** `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` (kernel/species type).
**Plain:** viewpoint library.

A `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` is a **catalogue of viewpoint bundles**, with at least:

* `libraryId : LibraryId` — lexical identifier of the library (e.g. `FPF.Core.Viewpoints`, `OrgX.EngineeringViewpoints`).
* `bundles : FinSet(U.ViewpointBundle)` — finite or countable set of bundles it provides.
* `editionId : EditionId` — edition of the library, subject to the usual LEX‑AUTH / LAT discipline (E.15).
* optional `scopeTags` and governance metadata (owner, change‑control).

**Normative constraints.**

1. Within a given `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` edition, `ViewFamilyId` values **SHALL be unique**.
2. Libraries **SHALL NOT** define new kernel episteme kinds or surface kinds; they only package `U.Viewpoint` values and metadata.
3. Libraries **MAY** be specialised:

   * a core FPF library (e.g. TEVB, generic governance bundles);
   * organisational libraries extending or subsetting core bundles.

##### 4.2.2 `U.ViewpointBundle` and `ViewFamilyId` (viewpoint family)

**Tech:** `U.ViewpointBundle` (species type), `ViewFamilyId` (lexical id).
**Plain:** viewpoint family, bundle of viewpoints.

A `U.ViewpointBundle` is a **family of compatible viewpoints** packaged for reuse. Minimal structure:

* `viewFamilyId : ViewFamilyId` — lexical id for the family (e.g. `VF.TEVB.ENG`, `VF.GovRisk`, `VF.ResearchMethod`).
* `EoIClassSpec ⊑ U.Entity` — class of entities this family is meant for (must be compatible with each viewpoint’s `EoIClassSpec`).
* `viewpoints : FinSet(U.Viewpoint)` — finite, non‑empty set of `U.Viewpoint` values (typically referenced via `U.ViewpointRef` in episteme cards).
* optional `ArchetypalCards : FinSet(U.ArchetypalGroundingRef)` — grounding cards per viewpoint (E.7).
* optional `AlignmentNotes` — e.g., ISO 42010 mappings, domain standard references.

**Normative constraints.**

VBL‑1. **EoIClass compatibility.**
For every `vp ∈ viewpoints`:

* `vp` **SHALL** resolve to a `U.Viewpoint` whose `EoIClassSpec` refines `EoIClassSpec` of the bundle (`EoIClassSpec(vp) ⊑ EoIClassSpec(bundle)`).

VBL‑2. **Finite, named family.**

* `viewpoints` **SHALL** be finite and non‑empty.
* Each `U.Viewpoint` **SHOULD** carry a stable `ViewpointId` (lexical id) distinct from `ViewFamilyId`.
* The same `U.Viewpoint` **MAY** appear in multiple bundles (e.g. a general “Regulatory” viewpoint in both engineering and governance bundles).

VBL‑3. **Lexical non‑collision.**

* `ViewFamilyId` **MUST NOT** be used as:

  * a `U.ViewId` / `U.ViewFamily(·)` id in MVPK,
  * a `SurfaceKind` or carrier kind in L‑SURF,
  * a generic `ViewpointId` without qualifier (E.18.S12).
* Libraries **SHOULD** adopt naming schemes that make the distinction clear, e.g. `VF.*` for families, `VP.*` for viewpoints, `PV.*` for publication viewpoints.

VBL‑4. **Intensionality.**

* A `U.ViewpointBundle` is **intensional**: it talks about the family of `U.Viewpoint` specs and their intended use; it does **not** contain any D/S epistemes, `U.View` instances, or `PublicationSurface` artefacts.
* Any concrete document or MVPK face referencing a family **SHALL** do so through its `ViewFamilyId` and per‑view `ViewpointId`, not by embedding the bundle.

##### 4.2.3 Binding bundles into `U.MultiViewDescribing`

`U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` organises families of descriptions/specifications for a fixed `<T,C>` (entity, context) with a finite viewpoint set Σ.

**Binding rule (informal).**

* Given a `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` and a bundle with `EoIClassSpec` compatible with the family’s `EoIClass`, a `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` instance **MAY** declare:

  * `ViewFamilyId` — the bundle that provides its “canonical” viewpoint set;
  * `ActiveViewpoints ⊆ viewpoints(bundle)` — the subset actually used in this `<T,C>` family.

**Normative constraints.**

VBL‑5. **Bundle import.**
For any `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` instance that declares a `ViewFamilyId`:

* its viewpoint set Σ **SHALL** be a finite subset of the `viewpoints` of that bundle;
* every D/S episteme in the family **SHALL** have `viewpointRef` in Σ (as required by E.17.0 / E.10.D2);
* every `U.View` attached to that family under E.17.0 **SHALL** preserve `viewpointRef` from Σ.

VBL‑6. **Multi‑bundle coordination.**
A single `<T,C>` family **MAY** rely on more than one bundle (e.g. TEVB + a safety bundle). In that case:

* the family **SHALL** declare how Σ is partitioned by `ViewFamilyId` (e.g. engineering vs safety);
* any CorrespondenceModel in the family that links views across families **SHALL** cite the relevant `ViewFamilyId` values.

VBL‑7. **No implicit bundles.**
If a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family does **not** declare a `ViewFamilyId`, its Σ is considered **local**. Such families are valid but:
* provide no guarantee of reuse in other projects;
* may be required, by organisational policy, to migrate to a library bundle before external publication.

### 5 · Archetypal grounding  *(informative)*

#### 5.1 · TEVB engineering viewpoints (preview species)

*Context.*
An engineering organisation wants a **standard family of viewpoints** for describing holons (`U.System` or `U.Episteme`) in E.TGA and MVPK.

*Bundle shape (TEVB, to be defined fully in E.17.2).*

* `viewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`
* `EoIClassSpec = U.Holon` (with species restriction “is `U.System` or `U.Episteme`”)
* `viewpoints = {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface, …}`

Each `VP.*` is a `U.Viewpoint` with:

* `StakeholderFamilies` drawn from engineering RoleEnactors (design, operations, safety);
* `Concerns` tuned to capability, process, structure, and interface questions;
* `AllowedEpistemeKinds` pointing to E.TGA‑level descriptions/specs;
* `ConformanceRules` linked to CV/GF check catalogues.

The bundle is defined once, in a shared library; E.TGA S12 then **imports** `VF.TEVB.ENG` and maps these viewpoints to E.TGA constructs without re‑defining them.

#### 5.2 · Governance & risk bundle

*Context.*
A governance team wants a reusable set of viewpoints across projects: “Risk”, “Control”, “Compliance”, “Operations”.

*Bundle shape.*

* `viewFamilyId = VF.GovRisk`
* `EoIClassSpec = U.Holon` (holons representing services or programmes)
* `viewpoints = {VP.Risk, VP.Control, VP.Compliance, VP.Operations}`

The same bundle is used:

* in a MultiViewDescribing family for a specific service holon;
* in a publication context where MVPK faces for governance reports reference `VF.GovRisk` and specific `VP.*` ids.

Archetypal grounding cards (E.7) illustrate each viewpoint with a 1‑page “Tell–Show–Show” example.

| ID                                           | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                          | Practical test                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CC‑VBL‑0 (Unique ViewFamilyId)**           | Within a library edition, each `ViewFamilyId` is unique and refers to exactly one `U.ViewpointBundle`.                                                                               | Scan library metadata; no duplicates; foreign keys resolve.                                |
| **CC‑VBL‑1 (EoIClass compatibility)**        | For every bundle, all `U.Viewpoint` members have `EoIClassSpec` refining the bundle’s `EoIClassSpec`.                                                                                | Check `EoIClassSpec(vp) ⊑ EoIClassSpec(bundle)` for each `vp`.                             |
| **CC‑VBL‑2 (Bundle‑backed families)**        | Any `U.MultiViewDescribing` family that declares a `ViewFamilyId` uses Σ equal to a finite subset of that bundle’s `viewpoints`; all D/S epistemes and views use `viewpointRef ∈ Σ`. | For each family, inspect Σ and `viewpointRef` fields; verify subset and coverage.          |
| **CC‑VBL‑3 (No surface hijack)**             | `ViewFamilyId` never appears as a `SurfaceKind`, MVPK face kind, or carrier type.                                                                                                    | Token scan of schemas and configs; no matches outside library metadata.                    |
| **CC‑VBL‑4 (Archetypal grounding coverage)** | For bundles intended for non‑expert authors, each viewpoint has at least one `U.ArchetypalGrounding` reference.                                                                      | For each such bundle, check that `ArchetypalCards` cover all `viewpoints`.                 |
| **CC‑VBL‑5 (Edition discipline)**            | Libraries and bundles are editioned; changes in viewpoint membership or semantics create new editions rather than silently mutating existing ones.                                   | LAT / change log shows edition bumps for breaking changes; older editions remain readable. |


### 7 · Cross‑cutting constraints & naming discipline  *(normative)*

1. **E.10 / A.6.5 alignment.**
   `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` **SHALL** follow LEX‑BUNDLE and `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`:
   * separate **Tech** and **Plain** registers in names and prose;
   * respect the `*Slot`/`*Ref` conventions from A.6.5 (no `ViewFamilySlot` here; `ViewFamilyId` is a lexical token, not a SlotKind);
   * treat `U.Viewpoint` as the ValueKind for `ViewpointSlot` and `U.ViewpointRef` as its RefKind (no new SlotKinds for viewpoint families);
   * avoid overloading `view`, `viewpoint`, `Surface`, `carrier`.

1. **Engineering vs publication viewpoint ids.**
   * Engineering viewpoint families (TEVB, E.TGA S12) use `EngineeringVPId` for `U.Viewpoint` in the bundle.
   * Publication viewpoint families (MVPK) use `PublicationVPId` for MVPK viewpoint ids.
   * A bundle **MAY** contain engineering viewpoints, publication viewpoints, or both, but the id namespaces **SHALL** be disambiguated (e.g. `VP.Eng.*` vs `VP.Pub.*`).

1. **ISO 42010 mapping.**
   * An ISO 42010 “viewpoint library” becomes a `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` edition.
   * Individual ISO viewpoints correspond to `U.Viewpoint` values inside one or more bundles.
   * ISO “architecture descriptions” correspond to concrete combinations of `U.MultiViewDescribing` families + MVPK surfaces that import those bundles; E.17.1 does not define architecture itself.

1. **Archetypal grounding linkage.**
   * For any bundle that is intended for non‑expert authors, each `U.Viewpoint` in `viewpoints` **SHOULD** have at least one `U.ArchetypalGrounding` card (E.7) referenced from the bundle.
   * These cards are didactic only; they do not alter the semantics of the viewpoints.

1. **Tooling hooks.**
   * Tools **MAY** treat `ViewFamilyId` as a primary key for viewpoint selection widgets, template libraries, or documentation navigation.
   * Tools **MUST NOT** infer semantics from the shape of `ViewFamilyId`; semantics come from the `U.Viewpoint` definitions.

### 8 · Consequences  *(informative)*

| Benefit                                    | Why it matters                                                                                                           | Trade‑offs / Mitigations                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reusable viewpoint families.**           | Teams and tools can share a common understanding of “functional view”, “risk view”, etc., across projects and domains.   | Requires governance of libraries and editions (E.15).                 |
| **Cleaner MultiViewDescribing instances.** | Families can say “we use TEVB+GovRisk” instead of spelling out Σ by hand.                                                | Local Σ are still allowed; migration to bundles may be an extra step. |
| **Better ISO 42010 alignment.**            | ISO viewpoint libraries become first‑class, mappable objects in FPF.                                                     | Needs careful mapping work per architecture sub‑domain.               |
| **Terminology hygiene.**                   | Distinguishing ViewFamilyId from ViewpointId and from surfaces reduces confusion in tooling and documentation.           | Enforced via LEX‑guards and CI checks.                                |
| **Cross‑domain reasoning.**                | The same bundle can be referenced from E.TGA, MVPK, and discipline packs, enabling consistent cross‑view correspondence. | Libraries must stay small and curated to avoid cognitive overload.    |

### 9 · Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*

* **ISO 42010 (Edition 2) viewpoint libraries.**
  ISO 42010 generalises *system‑of‑interest* to *entity‑of‑interest* and allows viewpoint libraries that define reusable viewpoint sets for architecture descriptions. `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` adopts this idea but generalises it beyond architecture to any `EoIClass`, and connects it to FPF’s explicit `U.Viewpoint`, I/D/S discipline, and episteme morphisms.

* **MBSE and SysML v2 view definitions.**
  Modern MBSE practice treats views as **queries over models** governed by named viewpoints, often organised into libraries or profiles. `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` provides a neutral representation of such libraries so that SysML‑like stacks can be integrated without hard‑coding their terminology into the core.

* **Safety and assurance cases.**
  Safety‑case frameworks (e.g. GSN‑based) implicitly rely on recurrent viewpoints (“hazard analysis”, “mitigation design”, “evidence aggregation”). Embedding them into bundles allows assurance‑oriented Viewpoint families to be reused and linked to Part F harnesses and ATS tiers.

* **Governance and research workflows.**
  Governance / audit frameworks and research pipelines similarly rely on recurring perspectives (e.g. “internal validity”, “external validity”, “reproducibility”). Viewpoint bundles allow these perspectives to be captured once and referenced across many MultiViewDescribing instances.

Overall, `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` is the mechanism by which **post‑2015 multi‑view practice** (viewpoint libraries, reusable view definitions) is integrated into the FPF stack without compromising strict I/D/S separation or the episteme slot discipline of C.2.1/A.6.5.

### 10 · Relations  *(informative summary)*

* **Builds on C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.**
  Uses `ViewpointSlot` / `ViewSlot` as the structural anchors for viewpoints and views; bundles provide reusable values for `ViewpointSlot`.

* **Builds on A.6.2–A.6.4.**
  Viewpoint bundles do not change episteme morphism laws; they parameterise which `U.EpistemicViewing` pipelines are admissible under a given viewpoint family.

* **Builds on A.7 / E.10.D2.**
  Description/specification epistemes remain I/D/S‑disciplined; bundles only constrain the `viewpointRef` part of `DescriptionContext`.

* **Builds on E.7.**
  Archetypal grounding cards for viewpoints are organised and referenced via bundles, making didactic examples reusable.

* **Constrains E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`.**
  Families that declare a `ViewFamilyId` must draw Σ from the corresponding `U.ViewpointBundle` (VBL‑5/6).

* **Constrains E.17 (MVPK).**
  MVPK viewpoint sets for publication **SHOULD** be declared as bundles in a library; MVPK faces must not treat `ViewFamilyId` as a surface kind.

* **Constrains E.17.2 (TEVB) and E.18.S12 (E.TGA engineering viewpoint families).**
  TEVB must be expressed as one or more `U.ViewpointBundle` instances; E.TGA S12 maps engineering viewpoints by referring to those bundles, not by defining its own opaque ids.

* **Coordinates with E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE) and E.15 (LEX‑AUTH).**
  `ViewFamilyId` and `ViewpointId` naming, editioning and evolution follow lexical and authoring protocols; migrations between library editions are tracked in LATs.

## E.17.2 — `TEVB — Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle`  \[A]

> **Tech‑name:** `TEVB` (Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle, bundle id `VF.TEVB.ENG`)
> **Plain‑name:** typical engineering viewpoints bundle for holons
> **Tag:** [A] — archetypal species of `U.ViewpointBundle` for engineering holons

**Status.** New; archetypal, notation‑agnostic species of `U.ViewpointBundle` / `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`.
It is an engineering‑level bundle over holons; it does not itself constitute an architecture framework or architecture‑specific viewpoint library. Architecture‑focused viewpoint bundles are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species that may import TEVB.

**Builds on.**
* **E.17.0 — `U.MultiViewDescribing`.** Supplies the generic notion of `U.Viewpoint`, `U.View`, and `ViewFamily` over an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` (here: `EoIClass = U.Holon`).
* **E.17.1 — `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`.** Provides the generic `U.ViewpointBundle`/`ViewFamilyId` structure; TEVB is a concrete bundle (`VF.TEVB.ENG`) in the core library.
* **A.1 — Holon.** Holon kinds `U.System` and `U.Episteme` as the typical engineering entities‑of‑interest.
* **A.6.2–A.6.4 — Episteme morphisms.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`, `U.EpistemicViewing`, `U.EpistemicRetargeting` as the generic morphism classes behind engineering views.
* **A.7 / E.10.D2 — Strict Distinction & I/D/S.** I/D/S discipline and DescriptionContext; engineering descriptions/specifications under TEVB are D/S‑epistemes with explicit `ViewpointRef`.
* **C.2.1 — `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.** Provides `DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot` and the slot discipline (A.6.5) used by TEVB‑aligned descriptions/specs.

**Used by.**
* **E.18.S12 — E.TGA viewpoint map.** As a canonical consumer, E.TGA binds its engineering transduction families (Functional, Procedural, Role‑Enactor/Device‑Structure, Module‑Interface) to TEVB viewpoints `VP.Functional`, `VP.Procedural`, `VP.RoleEnactor`, `VP.ModuleInterface`.
* **E.17 (MVPK).** Publication of engineering morphisms uses TEVB engineering viewpoints on the description/spec side and PublicationVPs on the Surface side.
* **Engineering description/spec patterns.** System, method, module/interface and role‑related description/spec patterns for holons (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`) refer to TEVB when declaring their `ViewpointRef`.
* **ISO‑aligned architecture‑description bundles.** Future species patterns for architecture‑specific viewpoint bundles reuse TEVB as the canonical engineering view family (Functional vs Structural etc.) over systems and their epistemes.

**Guard (lexical & ontological).**
1. **Engineering scope only.** TEVB applies to `EoIClass = U.Holon` with typical cases `U.System` and `U.Episteme`. Using TEVB viewpoints for non‑holonic entities (e.g., pure data structures, abstract theories) requires an explicit species‑level justification; by default it is a conformance violation.
2. **Viewpoint vs Surface.** `VP.Functional`, `VP.Procedural`, `VP.RoleEnactor`, `VP.ModuleInterface` are **viewpoints** (intensional `U.Viewpoint` specifications), **not** Surface kinds. They MUST NOT be used as carrier/Surface names (those remain `{PlainView, TechCard, NormsCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane, …}` under L‑SURF).
3. **EngineeringVPId vs PublicationVPId.** `VP.*` in this pattern are **EngineeringVPId** values (E.18.S12) and SHALL NOT be reused as PublicationVPs in MVPK. MVPK must introduce separate `PublicationVPId` symbols, linked to TEVB viewpoints only through correspondences.
4. **No new role coordinates in I/D/S.** TEVB references stakeholder groups via `U.RoleEnactor` families but does not introduce `U.Role` as a coordinate in I/D/S signatures (E.10.D2). Role semantics remain confined to RoleEnactment patterns (A.15, F‑R family).
5. **No extra viewpoints inside TEVB.** TEVB defines a **fixed core set** of four engineering viewpoints. Other labels such as “Assurance‑Oriented”, “Interop‑Oriented”, “Information/Data‑Oriented”, “Operational/Deployment”, “Mission/Context” may appear only as **lexical aliases** in E.18.S12 (e.g. as `ViewFamilyId` / `AliasInViewFamilies` values for transduction species). They MUST NOT extend `TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints` and MUST NOT be interpreted as additional `U.Viewpoint` kinds in this bundle; when SoTA or local practice demands explicit assurance, information, or mission viewpoints, these SHALL be provided as **separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species** that can be imported alongside TEVB rather than by mutating `VF.TEVB.ENG`.
6. **Not an architecture framework.** TEVB is an engineering‑level viewpoint bundle; architecture‑specific viewpoint bundles and architecture frameworks MUST be introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species that may import TEVB. They MUST NOT redefine `VF.TEVB.ENG` as an “architecture viewpoint library” or extend it with architecture‑only viewpoints.

### 1 · Problem frame  *(informative)*

Engineering teams almost always talk about systems and their models through a **small set of recurring “views”**:
* *What capabilities and behaviours does the system enact?* — function‑oriented, transduction‑oriented talk.
* *What sequences, workflows, and control logics does it realise?* — procedure/process/state‑oriented talk.
* *Who or what enacts which roles?* — role‑enactment, organisational and socio‑technical talk.
* *How is the system decomposed into modules and interfaces?* — physical/logical architecture talk.

In industry, these lenses show up under many names: *functional view, logical view, behavioural view, process view, structural/physical view, deployment view, responsibility view,* and so on. Modern standards and tools (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, INCOSE SE Handbook, SysML v2 “views as queries”) all recognise that **viewpoints should be reusable structures**, not ad‑hoc labels.

In FPF, E.17.0 and E.17.1 give the **generic machinery**:
* `U.Viewpoint` as an intensional specification (stakes/concerns/allowed D/S kinds),
* `U.View` as an episteme‑level view (epistema under a viewpoint),
* `U.ViewpointBundle` / `ViewFamilyId` as reusable collections of viewpoints.

E.TGA (E.18.S12) already assumes a **canonical engineering family** with names like “Functional”, “Procedural”, “Role‑Enactor (Device‑Structure)”, “Module‑Interface”. Without a formal bundle tying these together, those names drift and the mapping between E.TGA, MVPK and I/D/S becomes fragile.

TEVB addresses this by defining a **single, explicit engineering bundle** with a fixed `ViewFamilyId` and a small set of canonical engineering viewpoints over `U.Holon`.

### 2 · Problem  *(informative)*

Without TEVB, several failure modes recur:
1. **Inconsistent “functional/structural/behavioural” vocabularies.** Different teams define “functional view” or “process view” differently, even within one organisation; E.TGA S12 then has to guess how to map transduction graphs onto whichever interpretation is currently in play.
2. **Architecture frameworks leak into the kernel.** 4+1‑style and similar architectural frameworks get hard‑coded as if they were universal; FPF loses its holonic neutrality and becomes biased to a particular school.
3. **Viewpoints conflated with surfaces and files.** “Functional view” is used both for the underlying viewpoint and for a concrete document or dashboard; MVPK faces, E.TGA transduction families, and I/D/S disciplines become entangled.
4. **Role leakage into I/D/S.** Engineering views that are about role‑enactors are written directly in terms of `U.Role`, blurring the boundary between RoleEnactment (A.15) and description/spec layers, and breaking A.7/E.10.D2.
5. **Poor reuse across systems.** Even when organisations want to reuse the same engineering views across products, plants, or models, there is no canonical bundle to import; each programme recreates “its own” functional/structural views.

TEVB makes engineering viewpoint families **first‑class reusable bundles** and pins them to an explicit `EoIClass` (engineering holons) so that E.TGA, MVPK and discipline‑packs can align on the same vocabulary.

### 3 · Forces  *(informative)*

| Force                                       | Tension                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs domain idioms**           | We need engineering viewpoints that work for *any* holon (hardware/software/socio‑technical), yet remain recognisable to practitioners steeped in domain‑specific frameworks. |
| **Parsimony vs expressiveness**             | A small, stable **NQD‑front** set of engineering view families (Function, Behaviour/Process, Role‑Enactor, Module‑Interface) vs the temptation to proliferate specialised views for every stakeholder group or quality attribute. |
| **Neutral core vs architecture frameworks** | FPF core must stay neutral and not encode a specific framework (4+1, DoDAF, etc.), while still being compatible with them.                                                    |
| **Consistency vs organisational autonomy**  | Central TEVB definitions must be stable, yet individual organisations need room to refine concerns and episteme kinds within the bundle.                                      |
| **I/D/S clarity vs convenient shortcuts**   | Viewpoints must not re‑introduce `Role` as a coordinate in I/D/S, nor blur Description/Spec/Surface distinctions, even though practitioners informally mix these.             |

TEVB resolves these by fixing a **minimal engineering bundle** and leaving customisation to **species patterns and ViewpointBundleLibrary entries** that refine concerns and allowed episteme kinds without changing the core families.

### 4 · Solution — TEVB as a core `U.ViewpointBundle` for holons  *(normative)*

#### 4.1 TEVB bundle identity

TEVB is the **core engineering viewpoint bundle** over holons.

* **Bundle object.** There exists a canonical `U.ViewpointBundle` instance:

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle : U.ViewpointBundle
  ```

* **ViewFamilyId.**

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle.viewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG
  ```

  `VF.TEVB.ENG` is reserved for **“Typical Engineering Viewpoints (Engineering)”** in the FPF core ViewpointBundleLibrary.

* **EoIClassSpec (holon scope).**

  TEVB is parameterised by

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle.EoIClassSpec =
    { h : U.Holon | holonKind(h) ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme} }
  ```

  That is, TEVB applies to holons that are either `U.System` or `U.Episteme`. Other holon kinds MAY be added by species patterns but MUST be justified and documented; the default conformance profile assumes systems and epistemes.

* **Library placement.**

  TEVB lives in the core viewpoint library:

  ```
  TEVB.Library : U.ViewpointBundleLibrary
  TEVB.Library.libraryId = FPF.Core.Viewpoints
  TEVB.Library.bundles ⊇ { TEVB.EngBundle }
  ```

  Additional organisational libraries MAY import and specialise TEVB, but SHALL NOT redefine `VF.TEVB.ENG` with incompatible semantics.

* **Viewpoint set.**

  TEVB defines a **finite set of canonical engineering viewpoints**:

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints =
    { VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface }
  ```

The selection `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` is the current **NQD‑frontier** for engineering holon viewpoints in Part G: it realises a Function–Behaviour–Structure‑plus‑Role (`F–B–S+R`) cut that is non‑dominated against candidate families including explicit information/data, assurance/safety, and mission/context viewpoints under the N/U/C/D axes (C.18, G.0). Part G records the SoTA candidate set and rejected alternatives; TEVB only fixes the **core four** where each `VP.* : U.Viewpoint` is defined below. These four are the **only** viewpoints in the core TEVB bundle.

  > **Note.** Other ViewFamilyId values used in E.TGA (e.g., *Assurance‑Oriented*, *Interoperability‑Oriented*, *Information/Data‑Oriented*, *Operational/Deployment*, *Mission/Context*) remain **lexical families only** for transduction species (E.18.S12). They do not add viewpoints to TEVB; they are orthogonal to TEVB’s `viewpoints` set.

#### 4.2 TEVB engineering viewpoints

Each TEVB viewpoint is a `U.Viewpoint` with:
* `viewpointId : ViewpointId` (concrete identifier, e.g., `VP.Functional`);
* `EoIClassSpec` **inherited from the bundle** (`U.Holon` with `System`/`Episteme` kinds);
* `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(RoleEnactorFamilyId)` — families of `U.RoleEnactor` that are the primary audience;
* `Concerns : FinSet(ConcernId)` — engineering concerns this viewpoint foregrounds;
* `AllowedEpistemeKinds : FinSet(U.EpistemeKindRef)` — description/spec kinds admissible under this viewpoint (all obeying I/D/S discipline and C.2.1 slot discipline);
* `ConformanceRules : FinSet(RuleId)` — references to checklist items in conformance packs (CV/GF/engineering checklists).

The subsections below fix the **normative intent and minimal field profiles** for each TEVB viewpoint. Species patterns and discipline‑packs may refine `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds` and `ConformanceRules`, but MUST preserve the intent.

##### 4.2.1 `VP.Functional` — capability & transduction viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **what it can do** under roles: capabilities, transductions, and functional responsibilities, rather than in terms of modules or procedures.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.Functional : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EoIClassSpec.**
  Same as the bundle: `U.Holon` with `System`/`Episteme` kinds.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical examples).**
  Actual `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(U.RoleEnactor)` values are defined in RoleEnactment discipline packs; labels below are informal.
  * System engineering leads and architects (e.g. SysEng‑lead enactors).
  * Product owners / capability owners.
  * Reliability / performance engineers when reading capability envelopes.

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Capabilities and functions provided by the holon (`CapabilityConcerns`).
  * Behaviour under roles (`RoleBehaviourConcerns`).
  * Non‑functional envelopes: throughput, latency, availability, energy, safety (`NFPEnvelopeConcerns`).
  * Compositional semantics of functions/transductions (`TransductionCompositionConcerns`).

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.Functional` admits descriptions/specifications whose **DescribedEntitySlot** is a holon’s **capability/Method/Mechanism** under a role, e.g.:
  * `SystemFunctionalDescription`, `SystemFunctionalSpec` (species of `U.EpistemeKind` describing system‑level capabilities and their interconnection).
  * `TransductionDescription`, `TransductionSpec` (E.TGA functional lanes).
  * `ServiceCapabilityDescription`, `ServiceCapabilitySpec` (when a holon is in Service role).

  All such epistemes MUST:
  * obey I/D/S discipline: `…Description`/`…Spec` as D/S‑layers for `U.Method`/`U.Mechanism`/`U.Service`;
  * make their `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` explicit, with `ViewpointRef = VP.Functional`.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Functional flows are **total** over their declared domain (no implicit dangling capabilities).
  * Transductions are typed at interfaces (A.6.0, A.6.1) and respect A.6.2/A.6.3 purity/conservativity.
  * When functional views participate in retargeting patterns (e.g. structural reinterpretation species based on `U.EpistemicRetargeting`), they MUST satisfy the relevant retargeting constraints from A.6.4; concrete consumer patterns (such as E.TGA structural reinterpretation, E.18.S9) MAY impose additional rules.

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.Functional` corresponds to the “functional view” in ISO‑aligned architecture descriptions and domain reference architectures (functional viewpoints in IoT and space reference architectures, functional/logical layers in sector frameworks), and to the **Function** axis in FBS‑style design ontologies. It is also the natural home for SysML/SysML‑v2 capability and logical architecture models and for “logical view” slices in 4+1‑style frameworks, once recast into holon/capability terms.

##### 4.2.2 `VP.Procedural` — process & control viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **how behaviours are sequenced and controlled**: workflows, state machines, operational procedures, and control logic.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.Procedural : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EoIClassSpec.**

  Same as the bundle.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**
  * Operations and run‑time owners (`OperationsEnactorFamily`).
  * Control engineers and automation specialists (`ControlEngineerEnactorFamily`).
  * Safety engineers concerned with procedural correctness (`SafetyEngineerEnactorFamily`).

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Control flow and ordering of actions (`OrderConcerns`).
  * State‑machine behaviour and lifecycle (`StateLifecycleConcerns`).
  * Concurrency, synchronisation, and error handling (`ConcurrencyConcerns`).
  * Operational modes and transitions (startup, shutdown, degraded modes) (`OperationalModeConcerns`).

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.Procedural` admits descriptions/specifications where the **DescribedEntitySlot** is a method/process/control Behaviour for the holon, e.g.:
  * `MethodDescription`, `MethodSpec` for operational procedures (A.3.1–A.3.2).
  * `ControlLogicDescription`, `ControlLogicSpec` (IEC 61131‑3 style step diagrams/statecharts).
  * `WorkflowDescription`, `WorkflowSpec` (business processes, orchestration logic).

  These epistemes:
  * must respect the **order discipline** (Γ_method, Γ_ctx) and A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment);
  * must carry I/D/S‑conformant DescriptionContext with `ViewpointRef = VP.Procedural`.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Pre/post‑conditions at step boundaries are explicit and type‑checked (A.3.1/A.3.2, Γ_method).
  * No embedding of Work or calendars inside procedural descriptions (A.7/E.10.D2).
  * Failure modes and recovery actions are declared and traceable to safety analyses (F.15 harnesses where relevant).

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.Procedural` captures the dynamic/process dimension found in SoTA architecture and MBSE practice: process views in 4+1, operational/behavioural views in defence and enterprise frameworks, behaviour diagrams in SysML (activity, sequence, state, interaction), and procedure/control‑oriented models in industrial standards. TEVB abstracts this into a notation‑agnostic “behaviour over time” viewpoint for holons.

##### 4.2.3 `VP.RoleEnactor` — role & device‑structure viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **who/what plays which roles** and **how physical/organisational structure supports those roles**. This viewpoint covers both socio‑technical role assignments and “device view” readings of transduction graphs (E.TGA).

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.RoleEnactor : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EoIClassSpec.**

  Same as the bundle.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**
  * Organisational designers and operations managers (`OrgDesignEnactorFamily`).
  * Safety and compliance officers concerned with separation of duties (`SegregationOfDutyEnactorFamily`).
  * Hardware/system engineers concerned with which devices carry which functions (`DeviceEngineerEnactorFamily`).

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Which holons enact which roles under which contexts (`RoleEnactmentConcerns`).
  * Allocation of capabilities to devices/subsystems (`CapabilityAllocationConcerns`).
  * Organisational constraints: segregation of duties, responsibilities, escalation paths (`GovernanceConcerns`).
  * Device‑view readings of functional graphs (E.TGA Device‑View).

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.RoleEnactor` admits descriptions/specifications where the **DescribedEntitySlot** is a **role structure or capability allocation** associated with the holon, e.g.:
  * `RoleDescription`, `RoleSpec` (F.4, F.18) for human or system roles.
  * `RoleEnactmentDescription` for mappings `Holder#Role:Context` (A.15).
  * `DeviceAllocationDescription` mapping functions/transductions to physical modules or devices.

  As with other TEVB viewpoints, these are D/S‑epistemes with `DescriptionContext.ViewpointRef = VP.RoleEnactor`.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Role vs Method vs Work vs Capability separation is upheld (A.7, A.15).
  * Device‑view reinterpretation from functional flows MUST be expressed as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` with an explicit `KindBridge` witness (A.6.4). Specific retargeting schemes (for example, E.TGA’s structural reinterpretation in E.18.S9) may add further constraints but are not fixed by TEVB itself.
  * No “role as behaviour” conflation: Roles are masks, behaviours remain Methods/Work.

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.RoleEnactor` aligns with the allocation/responsibility and resource/organisational view clusters seen across MBSE frameworks: allocation views in UAF/NAF, role‑responsibility matrices and RACI‑style artefacts, and “who/what plays which role” slices in usage and operational viewpoints. Many post‑2015 reference architectures treat this axis implicitly; TEVB makes it explicit and holon‑centred while remaining compatible with socio‑technical and device‑allocation practices.

##### 4.2.4 `VP.ModuleInterface` — module & interface viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of its **modules, interfaces, and structural composition**: what parts exist, how they connect, and how their contracts are specified.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.ModuleInterface : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EoIClassSpec.**
  Same as the bundle.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**
  * Hardware and software architects responsible for structure (`StructureArchitectEnactorFamily`).
  * Integration and test engineers (`IntegrationEngineerEnactorFamily`).
  * Lifecycle and maintenance planners looking at replaceable units (`MaintenancePlannerEnactorFamily`).

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Module decomposition and containment (mereology) (`ModuleMereologyConcerns`).
  * Interfaces and contracts — ports, APIs, physical connectors (`InterfaceConcerns`).
  * Dependency structures and allowed couplings (`DependencyConcerns`).
  * Replaceability and variation points (`VariabilityConcerns`).

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.ModuleInterface` admits descriptions/specifications where the **DescribedEntitySlot** is a **structural architecture** of the holon, e.g.:
  * `SystemStructureDescription`, `SystemStructureSpec` (module/connector descriptions).
  * `ModuleInterfaceDescription`, `ModuleInterfaceSpec` (signature, contracts, physical interface definitions).
  * E.TGA‑style interface/port descriptions over `Signature`/`Mechanism` graphs.

  These epistemes describe the carrier (structure) rather than capability. Functional↔physical reinterpretations between `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface` are expressed via `U.EpistemicRetargeting` + `KindBridge` (A.6.4, E.18.S9).

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Interfaces are typed and explicitly bound to standards where applicable (A.6.0, F‑specs).
  * No inlining of Methods/Work into structure (strict separation of structure vs behaviour).
  * Reinterpretations from functional views into structure MUST respect the applicable `U.EpistemicRetargeting`/Bridge constraints (A.6.4). When combined with a concrete retargeting scheme (e.g. E.TGA structural retargeting, CC‑TGA‑06‑EX), that scheme’s additional rules also apply.

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.ModuleInterface` matches the structural/implementation/deployment families that dominate SoTA architecture descriptions: development and physical views in 4+1, construction/deployment viewpoints in IoT reference architectures, logical/physical architecture layers in UAF/NAF and RASDS‑style frameworks, and structural and interface‑focused models in SysML‑based MBSE. TEVB treats all of these as specialisations of a single holonic “modules and interfaces” viewpoint.

### 5 · Archetypal grounding  *(informative)*

A minimal TEVB instantiation looks as follows:

```
TEVB.EngBundle :
  U.ViewpointBundle {
    viewFamilyId   = VF.TEVB.ENG
    EoIClassSpec   = { h : U.Holon | HolonKind(h) ∈ {System, Episteme} }
    viewpoints     = { VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface }
    LibraryRef     = FPF.Core.Viewpoints
  }
```

Each `VP.*` viewpoint is a `U.Viewpoint` as in E.17.0, with:

* `viewpointId ∈ {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`,
* `EoIClassSpec` inherited from `TEVB.EngBundle`,
* `StakeholderFamilies`, `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds`, `ConformanceRules` aligned with the subsections above.

**Engineering holon (example).**

Let `Plant_X : U.System` be a production plant, and `ControlStack_X : U.Episteme` be its control and optimisation stack as a holon.

* Under `VP.Functional`, `Plant_X` is viewed as a bundle of capabilities and transductions: material/energy/product flows, optimisation functions, safety envelopes.
* Under `VP.Procedural`, `Plant_X` is viewed as sets of procedures and control sequences: startup/shutdown, normal operation, emergency handling.
* Under `VP.RoleEnactor`, `Plant_X` is viewed as networks of role‑enactors: human operators, controllers, subsystems enacting roles in SOPs and safety cases.
* Under `VP.ModuleInterface`, `Plant_X` is viewed as modules and interfaces: equipment units, pipelines, control modules, buses, and their interfaces/contracts.

Each of these is a **family of D/S‑epistemes** with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef(Plant_X or ControlStack_X), BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef=VP.*⟩` and TEVB ensures that E.TGA and MVPK can rely on this common structure.

### 6 · Conformance checklist  *(normative)*

**CC‑TEVB‑1 (Bundle identity).**
Any artefact claiming to be “TEVB engineering viewpoints” MUST:

* refer to `viewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`,
* have `EoIClassSpec = {h : U.Holon | HolonKind(h) ∈ {System, Episteme}}`,
* enumerate `viewpoints = {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` and no others.

**CC‑TEVB‑2 (Viewpoint definition).**
Each `VP.*` viewpoint MUST be a well‑formed `U.Viewpoint` per E.17.0:

* `viewpointId` equal to one of the four engineering IDs,
* `EoIClassSpec` equal to the bundle’s,
* `StakeholderFamilies`, `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds`, `ConformanceRules` explicitly declared.

**CC‑TEVB‑3 (DescriptionContext completeness).**
Every D/S‑episteme participating in a TEVB‑managed multi‑view family for a holon MUST have a `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` with:

* `DescribedEntityRef` referencing a `U.System` or `U.Episteme`,
* `ViewpointRef ∈ {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`,
* `BoundedContextRef` pointing to the engineering context (E.10.D1).

**CC‑TEVB‑4 (Separation from PublicationVPs).**
`VP.*` identifiers from TEVB MUST NOT be used as `PublicationVPId` in MVPK. Publication viewpoints live in MVPK and may **correspond** to TEVB engineering viewpoints via `CorrespondenceModel`, but are separate symbols.

**CC‑TEVB‑5 (No Role coordinate in I/D/S).**
TEVB‑aligned descriptions/specs MAY reference `U.RoleEnactor` families in `StakeholderFamilies` but SHALL NOT add `Role` or `RoleEnactor` as axes in I/D/S signatures beyond what A.7/E.10.D2 already provides. Role semantics stay in RoleEnactment patterns; TEVB just selects concerns.

**CC‑TEVB‑6 (Alignment with consumer viewpoint maps).**
When a pattern defines engineering viewpoint families named “Functional”, “Procedural”, “Role‑Enactor (Device‑Structure)”, or “Module‑Interface” over the same `EoIClass` and claims TEVB alignment (for example, E.TGA S12 viewpoint map), it MUST bind them to TEVB viewpoints as follows:

* “Functional” → `VP.Functional`,
* “Procedural” → `VP.Procedural`,
* “Role‑Enactor (Device‑Structure)” → `VP.RoleEnactor`,
* “Module‑Interface” → `VP.ModuleInterface`.

Any deviation MUST be explicitly documented as a species‑level extension and MUST NOT reuse `VF.TEVB.ENG`.

### 7 · Rationale & SoTA echoing  *(informative)*

#### 7.1 NQD‑grounded choice of the core four

Part G’s NQD discipline treats candidate viewpoint families as points in an N/U/C/D quality space (Use‑Value, Constraint‑Fit, Novelty, Diversity_P). Applied to a SoTA‑harvested candidate set of engineering viewpoints (Functional, Behavioural/Procedural, Structural/Module, Allocation/Role, Information/Data, Assurance/Safety, Mission/Context, Deployment/Operational, Business/Usage), this yields a small Pareto frontier for *engineering holon* viewpoints. On that frontier, the `F–B–S+R` cut implemented by `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` is the minimal set that:
* spans the Function–Behaviour–Structure ontology used in contemporary design theory while adding an explicit allocation/responsibility axis;  
* aligns with the “functional/process/structural/deployment” clusters recurrent in standards and architecture frameworks;  
* stays neutral with respect to domain‑specific qualities (`‑ilities`) and business/mission framing, which are captured in separate Q‑bundles and governance/viewpoint packs rather than in TEVB itself.

Other candidates (e.g. dedicated information, assurance, or mission viewpoints) remain important but either duplicate concerns already captured by TEVB (when specialised to engineering holons) or are better modelled as orthogonal quality bundles (C.25) or non‑engineering bundles (business/governance packs). TEVB therefore pins only the core four and leaves the rest to specialised families.

#### 7.2 Alignment with post‑2015 engineering practice

* Modern architecture standards built on ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 describe viewpoint libraries in which functional, behavioural/process, structural/deployment, and business/usage concerns are the dominant clusters; sector RAs such as IoT RA 30141 and space‑domain RAs provide explicit functional and construction/implementation viewpoints alongside business/usage and trustworthiness viewpoints. TEVB reuses the functional and construction/structural clusters as `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface`, while treating business and trustworthiness as separate bundles.  
* Model‑based systems engineering practice (INCOSE MBSE guidance, SysML v2 “views‑as‑queries”, UAF/NAF view grids) converges on a small set of core diagram families: structure vs behaviour vs allocation/responsibility vs requirements/mission. TEVB’s `VP.Procedural` and `VP.RoleEnactor` correspond to the behaviour and allocation/responsibility axes, respectively, and are designed to be notation‑neutral over SysML/UAF/UML/Capella‑style models.  
* The FBS family of design ontologies (Function–Behaviour–Structure and extensions) provides a widely used conceptual basis for separating what a system is for, what it does over time, and what it consists of. TEVB’s four viewpoints intentionally implement an FBS+R split at the holon level: `VP.Functional` ≈ Function, `VP.Procedural` ≈ Behaviour, `VP.ModuleInterface` ≈ Structure, with `VP.RoleEnactor` capturing the explicit mapping from functions/behaviours to role‑enacting carriers.  
* Within FPF itself, E.TGA’s “viewpoint families” (Functional, Procedural, Role‑Enactor/Device‑Structure, Module‑Interface, plus assurance/interoperability/data/operational/mission aliases) are harmonised by letting the **core four** be TEVB viewpoints and treating the rest as lexical or bundle‑level overlays, not as new kernel viewpoints.

#### 7.3 Why TEVB stays small

TEVB is deliberately *not* a complete architecture framework. It gives FPF a stable, holon‑centred engineering bundle that:
* is small enough to keep in working memory and to govern via EpistemeSlotGraph discipline;  
* is expressive enough to host mappings from SoTA architecture frameworks (4+1, domain‑specific RAs, UAF/NAF grids, SysML‑based MBSE method kits);  
* can be safely combined with additional `U.ViewpointBundle` species (safety/assurance packs, business/mission packs, information/data packs) without mutating the core four;
* sits conceptually **below** architecture‑specific viewpoint libraries, which are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species layering TEVB with mission/quality/business viewpoints instead of redefining TEVB.

As SoTA evolves, new bundles can be added or TEVB can gain a new edition with a revised NQD‑frontier, but the TEVB‑A edition fixed here remains the archetypal engineering bundle for holons.

### 8 · Relations  *(informative)*

* **Builds on.** E.17.0 (`U.MultiViewDescribing`), E.17.1 (`U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`), A.7/E.10.D2 (I/D/S), C.2.1 (EpistemeSlotGraph), A.6.2–A.6.4 (episteme morphisms).
* **Constrains.** E.18.S12 (E.TGA viewpoint map), engineering description/spec patterns, MVPK engineering publication profiles.
* **Coordinates with.** L‑SURF/L‑PUBSURF (Surface kinds), F‑R family (Role, RoleDescription, RoleSpec), F.18 (naming discipline for ViewFamilyId / ViewpointId / EngineeringVPId / PublicationVPId).
* **Non‑goals.** TEVB does not prescribe modelling notations (SysML, BPMN, IEC 61131‑3, etc.), storage formats, or tool APIs. It only fixes the **conceptual viewpoint bundle** that such tools must respect when claiming FPF alignment.

> **Episteme level.** MVPK treats each face as a `U.View` in the sense of C.2.1/E.17.0 (species `U.EpistemeView`). For a morphism `f`, every `Emit_s(f)` is such a view whose `DescribedEntitySlot`/`DescriptionContext` target is `f : U.Morphism` and whose `viewpointRef` is a publication `U.Viewpoint` (`PublicationVPId`) drawn from a `U.ViewpointBundle` (E.17.1/E.17.2). Slot discipline (`ViewSlot`/`ViewRef`) is inherited from C.2.1/A.6.5 and is not redefined in MVPK.

### 1 · Intent

Provide a **disciplined, compositional way to publish morphisms** (arrows) across multiple didactic faces (views/cards) **without adding semantics**, while keeping **viewpoints** (the specifications that constrain views) explicit and auditable. Authors get a small **view‑pack** that, when applied to any `U.Morphism` (including compositions), yields a **family of views** that commute with arrow composition and respect edition/measurement pinning (Part F/G).

### 2 · Problem frame

* Teams routinely need several **faces** of the *same* arrow: a **Tech card** for the catalog, an **Interop card** for machine exchange, a **Plain view** for narrative, and an **Assurance lane** for evidence.    
* Informal “renderings” quietly **drift semantics**; **composite arrows** are often published piecemeal, breaking traceability; **evidence** forgets unit/scale/edition pins.    
* “View” and “viewpoint” are **blurred** in practice; authors conflate **publication** with **mechanism**.    
* L‑SURF requires **Surface token discipline**; Core allows only **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface**; faces are **…View / …Card / …Lane** (no ad‑hoc `…Surface` kinds). 

**MVPK** fixes this by making publication a **typed, functorial projection** from existing D/S‑epistemes via species of `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3/E.17.0, A.7 §5.9/E.10.D2) subject to explicit **viewpoint specs** and **pinning guards**. **Part E is conceptual:** no machine‑exchange formats are specified here.

### 3 · Problem

1. **Semantic drift in publication.** Unchecked “presentations” introduce claims not present in the D/S‑epistemes about the arrow (epistemes with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` in the sense of E.10.D2/E.17.0).    
2. **Non‑compositionality.** Publishing `g∘f` yields surfaces that don’t match composing the surfaces of `f` and `g`.    
3. **View vs viewpoint confusion.** A single template is treated as “the view”, with no declared concerns or conformance rules.    
4. **Unpinned numbers.** Numeric claims lack unit/scale/reference‑plane and **edition pins** (Part F/G), undermining auditability.    

### 4 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Compositionality vs legibility** | Preserve arrow laws across views ↔ keep each view didactic and audience‑appropriate. |
| **Neutral naming vs domain idioms** | Use vocabulary stable across domains ↔ allow local templates (SOPs, APIs, checklists). |
| **Surface orthogonality (A.7)** | Publication must not mutate I/D/S semantics ↔ authors expect “rich presentations”. |
| **Evidence discipline** | Views must cite CG‑Spec/CHR anchors ↔ authors want compact cards. |

### 5 · Solution — the **MVPK Kit**

#### 5.0 USM anchoring (normative)
* **PublicationScope (USM).** Define `U.PublicationScope` in **USM** analogously to `U.WorkScope` and `U.ClaimScope`. An MVPK kit instance is **governed by** a `PublicationScope` that fixes:
  * (a) the **viewpoint index** `Σ` and its partial order `⪯`,
  * (b) the **profile** (MVPK‑Min/Lite/SetReady/Max) as a *configuration* of this scope,
  * (c) the admissible **Publication characteristics (PC)** and required **pinning contracts**,
  * (d) any **cross‑Context/plane** constraints (Bridge/CL policies) applicable to emitted faces.
* **Scope lineage.** `PublicationScope` participates in the same USM lineage regime as `WorkScope`/`ClaimScope` (editioning and migration rules); MVPK emits faces **under** a declared `PublicationScopeId`.
* **L, P, D, E quartet.** The canonical MVPK‑Max scope enumerates exactly four **face kinds**: `PlainView (P)`, `TechCard (T)`, `InteropCard (I)`, `AssuranceLane (A)`. If a program elects to retain the mnemonic **(L, P, D, E)** tuple, it MUST map it 1‑to‑1 onto these **face kinds** within `PublicationScope` and SHALL NOT introduce additional kinds without a USM extension.

#### 5.1 Terminology (normative)

* **View** (`U.View`): an episteme‑level view (`U.EpistemeView` in the sense of C.2.1/E.17.0) produced *under* a publication viewpoint. In MVPK each face (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`) is such a `U.View` whose `DescribedEntitySlot`/`DescriptionContext` target is a `U.Morphism` and whose `viewpointRef` is a publication `U.Viewpoint`.  
  Every MVPK `U.View` **SHALL** declare:  
  `SurfaceKind ∈ {PublicationSurface, InteropSurface}`, `PublicationVPId : U.ViewpointRef`, references to the underlying D/S‑epistemes produced by `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` in A.7/E.10.D2, and a `U.PublicationScope` (USM §6.5).  
  Any materialization/rendering is separate **Work on SCR/RSCR carriers** and is not part of `U.View`.
* **Publication vs presentation vs rendering vs representation (guard):**    
    * **Publication** = typed projection from existing D/S‑epistemes about a morphism onto a `U.View`/`PublicationSurface` via species of `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) under the I/D/S discipline of A.7/E.10.D2.        
    * **Presentation** = rhetorical arrangement of a published carrier; **notation‑neutral**, adds no claims and is **not** a Surface kind.        
    * **Rendering** = display/layout of a carrier, purely graphical/formatting; **Work on carriers** (A.7), not a Surface kind.        
    * **Representation** = episteme↔referent relation (C.2.1/A.6.2–A.6.4); **not** a surface act. Use **publication** and **view** here; treat presentation/rendering as **Work on carriers** (A.7).
* **ISO mapping note.** ISO **viewpoint** → `PublicationVPId` (publication layer); **engineering viewpoint** → `EngineeringVPId` (E.TGA §S12). An ISO **view** may be a single MVPK face; “bundles” are packaging only.
* **No‑mechanism equivalence:** MVPK **is not** a mechanism; any operational toil (build/render/upload) is **separate Work by a system on carriers** (A.7; see **Laws 5 — No Γ‑leakage** in §6).
* **ViewpointSpec (`U.Viewpoint`)** — a typed specification that declares stakeholders, concerns, conformance rules, allowed **Publication Characteristics**, and pinning requirements per profile. The index set `Σ` consists of identifiers of `U.Viewpoint` instances, typically drawn from `U.ViewpointBundle` species (E.17.1/E.17.2) (see §5.3).

#### 5.2 Allowed surfaces at Part E (L‑SURF discipline)
Part E restricts the term *Surface* to **PublicationSurface** and **InteropSurface**. Concrete faces SHALL be named **…View / …Card / …Lane**. 

**USM linkage (normative).** Every `U.View` **SHALL** declare a `U.PublicationScope` (USM §6.5).  
For a view **about an episteme** `E`: `PublicationScope(view_E) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`.  
For a view **about a capability** `C`: `PublicationScope(view_C) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.  
Cross‑context views **SHALL** cite Bridge + CL; **CL penalties apply to R only** (scope membership unchanged).

**L‑PUBSURF naming discipline**
 * Allowed surface kinds: **PublicationSurface**, **InteropSurface**.
 * Concrete faces MUST be named **…View / …Card / …Lane**.
* The tokens **carrier/bearer/holder** MUST NOT name a `U.View` or any publication entity.  
  Use **`U.View`** (PlainView / TechCard / InteropCard / AssuranceLane) for conceptual publication faces.  
  Reserve **carrier** exclusively for **SCR/RSCR** (symbol/document/data carriers) and **Work on carriers**.
* Avoid geometric metaphors (axis/dimension) for publication artifacts; use **Characteristic/CharacteristicSpace** only when referring to CHR‑MM entities.
* **Non‑collision guard.** `ViewFamilyId` (lexical tag for viewpoint families) MUST NOT be used to name any `U.View` or surface kind; MVPK face kinds remain **{PlainView, TechCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane}** only.

**MVPK‑Max viewpoints (normative; exactly four; governed by PublicationScope):**
* `PlainView` (explanatory prose view)    
* `TechCard` (typed catalog card)    
* `AssuranceLane` (evidence bindings/lanes)
* `InteropCard` (conceptual interoperability view; **mapping to concrete exchange formats lives in Annex/Interop; Part E does not specify schemas**)

**Lean profiles (small‑team friendly, optional; as PublicationScope configurations):**
* **MVPK‑Min (F0–F1):** Σ = {`PlainView`, `TechCard‑Lite`}. `AssuranceLane` omitted. No interop face.
* **MVPK‑Lite (F1–F3):** Σ = {`PlainView`, `TechCard‑Lite`, `AssuranceLane‑Lite` gated by crossing trigger}. `InteropCard` only if external consumers exist.
* **MVPK‑SetReady (F3–F5):** add `InteropCard` when replayability or external interchange is required (details outside Part E).
* **Escalation triggers:** (i) cross‑Context/plane reuse; (ii) QD/OEE replay needs; (iii) external consumption.
* **“‑Lite” variants (definition):** A *‑Lite* face removes optional fields only (never claims), keeps the same typing as its full counterpart, and MUST retain pins for any numeric content. Upgrading from *‑Lite* to full is a monotone **add‑fields** operation (no retractions).

#### 5.3 The kit (constructs)

1. **Object component** `ViewObj_s` for each viewpoint (see §5.1), to make types explicit.  
2. **Viewpoint set** `Σ : FinSet(U.Viewpoint)` with declared **partial order** `⪯` for formality/refinement (default chain: `PlainView ⪯ TechCard ⪯ InteropCard`; `AssuranceLane` is **orthogonal** and not ordered with respect to others).  
3. **Emitters** `Emit_s(·) : U.Morphism → U.ViewMorph_s` (one per `s ∈ Σ`).
4. **Coherence** (laws §6) + **Pin Characteristics** policy (UnitType/ScaleKind/ReferencePlane/EditionId) for any numeric/comparable content, grounded in CHR/UNM.    
5. **Interop anchors (conceptual)** for `InteropCard` (concerns/semantics only); **any concrete schema/exchange mapping is outside Part E** (Annex/Interop).

**Result:** `MVPK(f, Σ)` returns `U.ViewFamily(f)` whose components are `Emit_s(f)`. Reindexing across `s ⪯ t` is mediated by total object‑level coercions `PromoteView[s→t]_X` (see §6.2).

#### 5.4 Intensional I/O vs Publication (normative convention)
1) **I/O are intensional.** The **Input/Output** sections of a morphism describe **intensional** data types (I/D/S) only; they do **not** depend on any publication face.  
2) **No duplication on faces.** MVPK faces **do not duplicate** I/O lists; they publish a **minimal profile**: **presence‑pins**, **CG‑Spec/CHR anchors**, and **EditionId** only.  
3) **Signature reserved to intensional.** Use **“Signature”** exclusively for intensional objects (`U.Signature`, `U.PrincipleFrame`, …). On faces, avoid “signature” and use **TechName/PlainName**.  
4) **Lawful orders, return sets.** Whenever a face shows **selection or comparison**, it **returns sets / lawful partial orders** and **never hides scalarization**; cite a **ComparatorSetRef** for any total order.  
5) **Bridge routing, penalties.** Crossings go via **Bridge + CL**; publish **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** ids; penalties route to **R only** (never F/G).  
6) **Carrier anchoring & lanes.** On first mention, anchor carriers (**SCR/RSCR**); keep **Work occurrences** distinct from **epistemic claims** via lanes.  
7) **Publication ≠ execution.** No time/resource semantics on faces; any build/render/upload is separate **Work**.

#### 5.5 Pin & Publication characteristics (normative; never “axes”)
**Intent.** Make pinning and publication‑time measurement claims explicit, typed, and auditable without importing geometric metaphors. This section introduces **Publication characteristics** (PC) as CHR‑grounded, publication‑level facets that can legally appear on MVPK faces.

**Terminology (aligned with CHR‑MM & UNM).**
* **Characteristic** (`U.Characteristic`): a measured aspect as defined in CHR‑MM (entity/relation characteristic with a chosen **Scale**).  
* **CharacteristicSpace** (`U.CharacteristicSpace`): a CHR‑typed product of slots used by dynamics/measurement theories (A.19).  
* **Publication characteristic** (`U.PubCharacteristic`, **PC**): a **declarative facet** that a view/card/lane may expose *about a morphism* under a stated **Viewpoint**. Each PC is **backed by** CHR/CG‑Spec artifacts and **pinned** by {unit/scale/reference‑plane/edition}. PCs are **not** geometry and do **not** define “axes”.

**PC catalog (initial set).** MVPK defines a minimal open set of PCs that are frequently surfaced:
* **PC.Number** — numeric/comparable entries (thresholds, budgets, counts). **Pins required:** unit, scale, reference‑plane, edition.  
* **PC.EvidenceBinding** — bindings to evidence carriers and policies (e.g., PathSliceId, BridgeId, CL notes).  
* **PC.ComparatorSetRef** — an explicit comparator family for lawful partial orders on faces.  
* **PC.CharacteristicSpaceRef?** — optional pointer when a face needs to cite the **space** in which a claim is interpreted (e.g., dominance on a declared space).  
The catalog **MAY** be extended (see “Extensibility” below); PCs **must** remain declarative (no embedded mechanisms).

**Norms (E17‑PC).**
* **E17‑PC‑1 (CHR grounding).** Every PC that yields numeric/comparable content **SHALL** cite CHR/CG‑Spec anchors and carry pins {unit, scale, reference‑plane, edition}.  
* **E17‑PC‑2 (Lexical discipline — no geometry).** Faces and PCs **MUST NOT** use “axis”, “dimension”, or geometric metaphors; use **Characteristic**, **slot**, **CharacteristicSpace** where applicable (**E.10**; see also A.19).  
* **E17‑PC‑3 (No hidden arithmetic).** Faces **MUST NOT** smuggle aggregation/normalization; any such logic lives in **CG‑Spec** (UNM/NormalizationMethod) and is cited by **…Ref.edition**.  
* **E17‑PC‑4 (Plane & crossing).** When a PC depends on **ReferencePlane** or crosses planes/contexts, the face **SHALL** cite `BridgeId` and **CL** policy‑ids; penalties route to the **R‑channel only**.  
* **E17‑PC‑5 (Edition pinning).** PCs that rely on maps or distances **SHALL** pin `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and, if used, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` / `TransferRulesRef.edition`.  
* **E17‑PC‑6 (Viewpoint scope).** Each PC instance declares the **Viewpoint** under which it is valid; promotion `PromoteView[s→t]` **MUST NOT** strengthen claims; at most, it reindexes or annotates.  
* **E17‑PC‑7 (Comparator/SetSemantics edition).** `PC.ComparatorSetRef` and any `SetSemanticsRef` **SHALL carry edition identifiers**; cards MUST be re‑emitted upon edition change with migration notes.

**Surfaces & responsibilities.**
* **PlainView** MAY include **PC.Number** iff fully pinned; otherwise it uses **compare‑only** language.  
* **TechCard** SHOULD carry **PC.Number**, **PC.ComparatorSetRef**, and **PC.CharacteristicSpaceRef?** when faces enable lawful ordering.  
* **AssuranceLane** SHALL carry **PC.EvidenceBinding** and the pins for any numeric claims it relays.  
* **InteropCard** MAY reference PCs conceptually but SHALL remain notation‑neutral in Part E (schemas map in Annex/Interop).

**Rationale.** MVPK is a publication discipline, not a measurement calculus. By naming **Publication characteristics** and pinning them to CHR/UNM, we:
1) prevent geometric leakage (no “axes”);  
2) keep publication neutral yet auditable;  
3) enable lawful set/ordering behavior on faces via explicit **ComparatorSet**;  
4) make plane/crossing obligations first‑class and checkable by declared publication checks / **OperationalGate(profile)** GateChecks.

**Extensibility.**
* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑1 (Open catalog).** New PCs MAY be added under `U.PubCharacteristic` provided they are declarative and CHR/UNM‑grounded.  
* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑2 (Kinding).** New PCs MUST declare `kind ∈ {Number, EvidenceBinding, SelectorHint, …}` and a **pinning contract**.  
* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑3 (Twin‑register names).** Supply **Tech** and **Plain** twins; avoid tokens that collide with E.10 bans; do not coin “…Space” names for publication artifacts.  
* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑4 (Edition discipline).** If a PC depends on a definitional artifact, **edition‑pin** the reference (`…Ref.edition`) and document migration rules.

**Adding invariants (procedure).**
1) Place **new invariants** for PCs in **CG‑Spec** (S‑layer), not on faces; supply acceptance tests.  
2) Version any affected **CharacteristicSpace**; publish embeddings if semantics change; never mutate slots in place.  
3) Update **AH‑3/AH‑4 (or AH‑L3/AH‑L4)** to warn/block per **E.11‑M2** red‑lines; never weaken functorial laws.  
4) **Document** edition/migration rules; extend §9 with a conformance item and provide **Lean‑profile downgrade** (advisory vs block) where applicable.

#### 5.6 Author ergonomics (non‑normative)
*Quick path for authors (three steps and a micro‑template):*
1. **Declare Σ and profile.** Choose `{PlainView, TechCard, …}` and whether faces are full or *‑Lite*.
2. **Pin once, reuse everywhere.** Attach `{UnitType, ScaleKind, ReferencePlane, EditionId}` to the arrow; cards reference these pins by ID (no duplication).
3. **Emit & verify.** Generate all faces from the arrow.

*Guidance:* treat *‑Lite* as **field‑drop only**; never add claims in *‑Lite*. 

### 6 · Laws (normative)

For any composable arrows `X —f→ Y —g→ Z` in `U`, and any `s, t ∈ Σ_viewpoints`:

1. **Functoriality & typing (per‑viewpoint).**  
    * (a) **Identity:** `Emit_s(id_X) = id_{ViewObj_s(X)}`.    
    * (b) **Composition:** `Emit_s(g∘f) = Emit_s(g) ∘ Emit_s(f)`.    
    * (c) **Typing (totality):** if `f : X → Y` then `Emit_s(f) : ViewObj_s(X) → ViewObj_s(Y)` is **total**; ill‑typed composites must be fixed via `ViewObj_s`, not by weakening laws.    
    * *Intuition:* every viewpoint acts functorially on arrows; publication does not break arrow algebra.
2. **Reindexing coherence (monotone refinement + naturality).**    
    * (a) If `s ⪯ t` then the `t`‑view **refines** the `s`‑view for the same morphism (**no content extension**; increased formality/typing only).    
    * (b) For each `s ⪯ t` there are **object‑components** `PromoteView[s→t]_X : ViewObj_s(X) → ViewObj_t(X)` natural in `X`, i.e., for every `f : X → Y`  
      `PromoteView[s→t]_Y ∘ Emit_s(f) = Emit_t(f) ∘ PromoteView[s→t]_X`.    
    * (c) **Coherence:** `PromoteView[s→s]_X = id_{ViewObj_s(X)}`, and if `s ⪯ t ⪯ u` then `PromoteView[s→u]_X = PromoteView[t→u]_X ∘ PromoteView[s→t]_X` for all `X`.         
    * *Defaults:* `PlainView ⪯ TechCard ⪯ InteropCard`.    
    * *Note:* `AssuranceLane` is **orthogonal** to the chain; it binds **evidence‑about‑claims** and MUST NOT introduce new claims **of** the morphism. 
3. **D/S sourcing & EpistemicViewing compatibility (A.7/E.10.D2, A.6.2–A.6.3, E.17.0).**    
    * (a) Inputs to `Emit_s(·)` are **existing D/S‑epistemes** about the same arrow (for example, `MethodDescription`, `MethodSpec`) produced by `Describe_ID` and `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` in A.7/E.10.D2. MVPK does **not** redefine or collapse these I→D→S morphisms.  
    * (b) Each `Emit_s(·)` SHALL be realised as a species of `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) over those D/S‑epistemes: describedEntity‑preserving, effect‑free and conservative in the sense of A.6.2/A.6.3. Publication adds no new commitments beyond what is present in the referenced D/S‑epistemes.  
    * (c) Edition governance respects `U.EditionSeries`/UTS; rows remain the identity anchors for names; MVPK faces MUST be (re‑)emitted when the underlying D/S editions change.
4. **Pin discipline (Part F/G).**  
     * Any numeric/comparable content in a view SHALL pin {UnitType, ScaleKind, ReferencePlane}. **EditionId MAY be coarse at Lean profiles**; if units/scale are unknown, **declare ordinal/compare‑only** and **forbid arithmetic** until CHR pins are available.  Pins upgrade monotonically with profile and risk.
5. **No Γ‑leakage (publication independence).**  
    Publication morphisms carry **no** Γ\_method / Γ\_time / Γ_work semantics. Any build/render/upload toil is **separate Work by a system on carriers** (A.7).    
     **Lean assurance lane:** `AssuranceLane‑Lite` MAY expose only presence bits for {PathId/PathSlice?, Γ_time window?, BridgeId?}; unknowns propagate (tri‑state) with an explicit {degrade|abstain|sandbox} policy note.
6. **Carrier provenance.**  
    Every emitted view records its **SCR/RSCR ids** on first occurrence (A.7 §5.6).
7. **Isomorphism preservation.**    
    * If `f` is an isomorphism in `U`, then `Emit_s(f)` is an isomorphism in `View_s(U)`; inverses map accordingly.  
8. **Cross‑Context/plane bridging.**    
    * If a view crosses contexts or reference planes, it **SHALL** cite the **Bridge + CL policy ids** (A.7 §5.8, “Bridge routing”). Such crossings MUST be explicit on `TechCard` and `AssuranceLane`.
9. **Totality of publication morphisms.**    
    * Publication maps are total on their domains; when a composition in a view would be ill‑typed, the author **must** fix the object mapping (via `ViewObj_s`) rather than weakening functoriality or reindexing laws.
10. **PublicationScope discipline (subset & composition).**  
    * (a) **Subset law:** If a view `v` is about episteme `E` then `PublicationScope(v) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`; if about capability `C` then `PublicationScope(v) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.  
    * (b) **No widening by refinement:** If `s ⪯ t`, then promotion `PromoteView[s→t]` MUST NOT widen `PublicationScope`.  
    * (c) **Compositional bound:** For composable arrows `X —f→ Y —g→ Z`,  
      `PublicationScope(Emit_s(g∘f)) ⊆ PublicationScope(Emit_s(g)) ∩ PublicationScope(Emit_s(f))`.

### 8 · Examples (SoTA‑echoing)

1. **Composite service pipeline (Interop + Assurance).**  
    `f: Parse → Normalize`, `g: Normalize → Score`.
    `InteropCard(g∘f)` is an interoperability **view** whose path set equals the **relational composition** of the two cards; `AssuranceLane(g∘f)` cites test artefacts as evidence **carriers** with edition pins. (Carriers, not semantics; concrete envelope formats are outside Part E.)
2. **Control loop morphism (Tech + Plain).**
    * For `h: Setpoint → Actuation`, `TechCard(h)` is a typed card with units; `PlainView(h)` narrates the same mapping with no new claims. (Monotone formalization echoes refinement‑typed stacks.)
3. **Optics‑style compositional views.**
    * Treat each `Emit_s(–)` as a **profunctor optic** from arrow semantics to its projection; then (by optics laws) `Emit_s(g∘f) = Emit_s(g) ∘ Emit_s(f)`. *Modern echo:* profunctor/optic literature (2017–2019) establishes precisely the kind of **compositional view** MVPK requires.  

### 9 · Conformance checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement | Practical test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC‑MVPK‑0 (Lean publication guard)** | For Lean profiles, a minimal guard runs: (i) set‑returning selection present; (ii) ReferencePlane present; (iii) any crossing cites BridgeId+CL with penalties routed to R only. | Validation report shows presence bits; penalties route to R only. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑1 (Viewpoint explicit)** | Each view declares its **Viewpoint** (stakeholders, concerns, conformance) as a publication `U.Viewpoint`. | Cards show `PublicationVPId` (or equivalent publication‑viewpoint field) and concerns. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑2 (Functoriality)** | `Emit_s(id)` is identity; `Emit_s(g∘f) = Emit_s(g)∘Emit_s(f)`. | Compose two cards and diff with the card of the composite. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑3 (No content extension)** | `PlainView`, `TechCard`, and `InteropCard` add **no new claims** beyond the underlying D/S‑epistemes. | Red‑line vs D/S episteme output (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) shows only formatting/indexing. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4 (Pins & anchors)** | Numbers/thresholds pin {...}. **Lean exception:** at MVPK‑Min/Lite profiles, EditionId MAY remain coarse; ordinal claims are legal only as compare‑only (no means/z‑scores). | Validation shows pins present or compare‑only mode engaged. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4b (Lean assurance)** | If `AssuranceLane‑Lite` is used, presence bits for {PathSliceId?, BridgeId?} suffice; full artefact lists are deferred. | Presence bits visible; deferred artefacts marked TODO. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4c (I/O vs publication)** | Faces **do not** restate I/O; they carry **presence‑pins + anchors + EditionId** only. | Face inspection shows no I/O duplication. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4d (Lawful orders)** | Any selection/comparison on faces **returns sets / lawful partial orders** with a **ComparatorSet** citation. | No hidden scalarization; ComparatorSetRef present. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4e (Signature on faces — banned)** | The term **“signature”** is **not used** on faces; use **TechName/PlainName**. | Token scan: no “signature” on faces. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4f (PC discipline)** | Any numeric/comparable publication uses **Publication characteristics** (PC) and carries pins {unit, scale, reference‑plane, edition}. | Cards show PC fields + pins; validation passes. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4g (No axis/dimension)** | Faces avoid “axis/dimension/plane” metaphors except **ReferencePlane**; use CHR terms (**Characteristic/slot/CharacteristicSpace**). | Lexical check flags none; only `ReferencePlane` appears. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4h (Edition pins on defs)** | Where maps/distances/spaces are cited, the face pins `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition?`. | Validation shows edition fields populated. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4i (Crossings gated)** | Plane/Context crossings cite **Bridge + CL** policies; penalties route to **R‑channel** only. | IDs present; routing verified in harness logs. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4j (PublicationScope present)** | Each view **declares `U.PublicationScope`** (USM §6.5). | Field present; presence‑bit green. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑4k (Subset‑of underlier)** | For views about epistemes/capabilities, `PublicationScope ⊆ ClaimScope/WorkScope`; reindexing **does not widen** it. | Subset witness passes; promotion diff shows no widening. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑5 (Carrier anchoring)** | First mention includes **SCR/RSCR** ids. | SCR ids visible on the card. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑6 (Γ‑separation)** | No cost/time/data‑spend on publication morphisms. | CI shows proofs/witness artefacts; gate validation passes. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑7 (Reindexing monotone)** | If `s ⪯ t`, then `Emit_s(x) ⪯ Emit_t(x)`. | `TechCard` ≤ `InteropCard` (more structure, same claims). |
| **CC‑MVPK‑8 (Surface discipline)** | Only **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** are used; faces named …**View/…Card**. | Token scan; no “rendering/presentation” as surface kinds. |
| **CC‑MVPK‑9 (Reindexing naturality)** | Reindexing coercions `PromoteView[s→t]` exist, are total, and commute with composition. | Witness shows `PromoteView[s→t]_Z ∘ Emit_s(g∘f) = (Emit_t(g) ∘ Emit_t(f)) ∘ PromoteView[s→t]_X`. |

### 10 · Anti‑patterns (with fixes)

1. **“Presentation logic” as semantics.**  
    *Fix:* Move any logic to `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` or CG‑Spec/KD‑CAL; keep views declarative; publication adds **zero** claims.    
2. **Publishing only objects.**  
    *Fix:* MVPK **acts on arrows**. Always emit views for `g∘f`, not just for objects `X, Y, Z`.    
3. **Unpinned numbers.**  
    *Fix:* Reject card; supply **pins** and CG/CHR anchors.    
4. **Viewpointless views.**  
    *Fix:* Define Viewpoint; attach concerns + conformance; re‑emit.    
5. **Interop ≡ Tech duplication.**  
    *Fix:* `InteropCard` may refine typing/shape but cannot contradict `TechCard` (reindexing monotone).    

### 11 · Consequences

| Benefit | Why it matters | Trade‑off / Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Arrow‑level traceability.** | Composition preserved across views enables chain‑of‑evidence on pipelines. | Slight authoring overhead → MVPK templates. |
| **Audit‑ready surfaces.** | Pins + CHR anchors make numeric claims verifiable. | Gate‑based validation performs checks. |
| **Terminology hygiene.** | Clear View vs Viewpoint, Publication vs Presentation. | Enforce L‑SURF tokens in CI. |
| **Notation independence.** | Viewpoints talk concerns, not tools. | Provide adapters to local stacks. |

### 12 · SoTA-echoing (post‑2015; conceptual pointers)

* **Profunctor/optic accounts (2017–2019).** Establish **compositional “views”** that compose like arrows—mirrors MVPK’s functorial law.    
* **Refinement‑typed ecosystems (2016→).** Units/scale at type level echo **pin discipline**.    
* **Interoperability & evidence envelopes.** External standards exist, but **their concrete formats live outside Part E** (see Annex/Interop for examples and mappings).

(References are illustrative exemplars of practice; MVPK remains notation‑agnostic.)

### 13 · Relations

* **Builds on:** A.7/E.10.D2 (Strict Distinction & I/D/S discipline), A.6.2–A.6.3 (episteme morphisms, `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` / `U.EpistemicViewing`), E.17.0 (`U.MultiViewDescribing`), E.8 (Authoring conventions), E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE incl. L‑SURF), Part F/G (UTS, CG‑Spec, CHR pins).    
* **Constrains:** Any surface‑emitting automation; must treat publication as a species of `U.EpistemicViewing` over existing D/S‑epistemes, not as a new I→D→S mechanism.    
* **Coordinates with:** B‑operators (no Γ‑leakage), C‑cluster (selection/archives: views are publication faces, not selections), **CHR‑MM** (measurement semantics), **UNM** (normalization families).

### 14 · Minimal authoring template (E‑level)

**Header:** `MVPK v⟨edition⟩ — Σ = {PlainView ⪯ TechCard ⪯ InteropCard, AssuranceLane ⟂}`  
**For each arrow `f`:** emit `{Emit_s(f) | s ∈ Σ}` (or use the plain aliases `{PlainView(f), TechCard(f), …}`) with: **PublicationScope**, ViewpointId, pins, CHR/CG anchors, SCR ids, Bridge+CL ids (if crossing), and—if composite—machine‑checkable witnesses that `Emit_s(g∘f) = Emit_s(g)∘Emit_s(f)` **and** for each `s ⪯ t` the naturality square `PromoteView[s→t]_Y ∘ Emit_s(f) = Emit_t(f) ∘ PromoteView[s→t]_X`.

### 15 · Manager’s one‑page review (copy‑paste)

> “We publish every **morphism** under a declared **set of viewpoints** using **MVPK**. Each **view** is **functorial** (identities, composition), **adds no new claims**, and pins **unit/scale/reference‑plane/edition** with **CHR/CG** anchors. **Interop** views clarify concerns/semantics only (concrete exchange lives outside Part E); **Assurance** cites evidence carriers (SCR). Any cross‑Context/plane view cites **Bridge+CL** (Φ→R only). Publication toil is **Work on carriers**, not a mechanism change.” 

## E.18 **Transduction Graph Architecture** (E.TGA) · \[A]

> **Tech‑name:** **E.TGA** (pattern label)
> **Plain‑name:** Architecture of the transduction graph
> **Twin labels:** Tech / Plain per E.10; faces emitted via E.17 MVPK (no schemas in Part E). 

### 1 · Intent

Provide a **notation‑independent** architecture for graphs whose vertices are **morphisms (transductions)** and whose edges are **typed transfers**. The architecture is **agnostic to the concrete morphism set** and equips the graph with **publication, comparability, crossing, and budget** disciplines so that **flows** are **valuations over paths** within the same object. Faces appear via **MVPK**; numeric/comparable publication carries **pins** with **Bridge/CL** notes; Φ/CL^plane penalties remain in **R**.  
*Style note:* wording follows the **counterfactual register** of FPF: invariants are stated as model conditions, not deontic obligations (per E.8 style and the assignment).

### 2 · Problem frame

Teams can produce many **valid flows** over the same capability: e.g., the assignment’s reference path
`U.FormalSubstrate → U.PrincipleFrame → U.Mechanism → U.ContextNormalization (UNM) → U.SelectionAndBinding ↔ U.WorkPlanning → U.Work → U.EvaluatingAndRefreshing`
is one **path** among many possible domain paths. Without a common **graph‑level architecture**:

* flows look ad‑hoc and **non‑comparable**;
* cross‑Context **crossings** (plane/Context changes) are undocumented;
* publication surfaces **smuggle arithmetic** or restate I/O;
* set‑returning selection is silently replaced by **single scores**;
* cycles lack **budget** discipline; refresh is **out‑of‑band**.

MVPK already fixes publication drift at the **single‑arrow** level; E.TGA lifts those **publication and comparability laws** to the **graph as a whole**. 

### 3 · Problem

1. **Morphisms ≠ Graph.** A catalog of morphism‑level patterns (e.g., UNM, Selector, Work, Refresh) does not, by itself, explain **how the whole graph is built, constrained, and audited**.
2. **Flow proliferation.** Multiple “reference flows” can be authored; readers need **one orchestration** that keeps them legal and comparable **without privileging any single flow**.
3. **Unsafe publication.** Faces re‑list I/O, hide scalarization, or omit edition/plane pins; cross‑Context reuse lacks **Bridge/CL** citation; **plane penalties** leak to F/G. 
4. **Cycles without norms.** Selection↔Planning loops run without explicit **budget (Γ_time)**, **FreshnessRequest**, or **slice‑scoped** refresh; **Work** bindings are made too early (outside `U.Work`). 

### 4 · Forces

| Force                                            | Tension                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs specialization**               | One architecture must host supply chains, water networks, ML functionals, and the assignment’s “first‑principles → work” path, **without** baking in any one morphism set. |
| **Publication neutrality vs auditability**       | Keep faces notation‑neutral and non‑mechanistic ↔ require **pins**, **ComparatorSet**, **Bridge/CL**, and **PublicationScope**.                                            |
| **Set legality vs business pressure for totals** | Preserve **return‑sets / lawful partial orders** ↔ stakeholders demand single numbers.                                                                                     |
| **Cross‑Context reuse vs safety**                | Enable reuse across `U.BoundedContext` ↔ enforce **Bridge/CL** with **R‑only penalties**.                                                                                  |

### 5 · Solution — the E.TGA kit (graph model + choreography)

#### S1 · Graph object (conceptual)

Define a **typed, editioned, directed multigraph**
`TransductionGraph := (V, E, τ_V, τ_E, Γ_time, Bridge, CL, TransportRegistry^Φ)`
with:

* **Vertices `V`:** instances of `U.Morphism` (open world). Common specialisations **include but are not limited to** the assignment’s set: `U.FormalSubstrate`, `U.PrincipleFrame`, `U.Mechanism`, `U.ContextNormalization (UNM)`, `U.SelectionAndBinding`, `U.WorkPlanning`, `U.Work`, `U.EvaluatingAndRefreshing`. This list is **illustrative**, not exhaustive—the graph **does not depend** on this particular set.
* **Edges `E`:** a **single edge kind `U.Transfer`** (typed) carrying artifacts/tokens; all **plane/Context/edition** changes occur **only at nodes via `OperationalGate(profile)`** with **Bridge + CL** annotations; penalties **→ R only**. Transport conversions pin **Φ‑policies** and editions.
* **Scopes:** `Γ_time` (budgets, horizons), `PublicationScope` for faces (E.17), and **slice ids** for refresh (G.11).

 **CtxState (PS‑projection; closed slots):** `CtxState = ⟨L, P, E⃗, D⟩` is the **projection of E.17 Publication Scope**.
 **Slot definitions (normative):**
  • `L := Locus` — an element of a partially ordered **ContextSlice** poset; addresses *where* claims apply (disciplinary / organizational / holonic slice).
  • `P := ReferencePlane` — the reference plane/units registry id; **no plane/unit declarations or translations** occur in CV; crossings remain gated (A.21).
  • `E⃗ := Edition vector` — a **partial map** `edition_key ↦ EditionId` over named families `{CG‑Spec, ComparatorSet, UNM.TransportRegistryΦ}` and optional `{DescriptorMapRef, DistanceDefRef, CharacteristicSpaceRef}` when cited.
  • `D := DesignRunTag` — `design(T^D)` or `run(T^R)`, used by **LaunchGate** and acceptance/telemetry duties.
 **Invariants.** Raw `U.Transfer` does **not** mutate `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`; any change or entry to `U.WorkEnactment` occurs at `OperationalGate(profile)`.
 **Extension discipline.** Any extra slot beyond ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ **SHALL** be registered in the **E.17/LEX “CtxState Extension Registry”** with slot‑id, intent, partial‑order law (neutral/absorbing), and SquareLaw compatibility; unregistered extensions are non‑conformant.
 **Data‑shape location.** Concrete record shapes for `PathId/PathSliceId`, Γ‑pins, and lineage remain in A.22 `FlowSpec`; E.TGA fixes that **flow = valuation** and that `CtxState` is preserved across raw transfers.

 * **Kinds:** `U.Transduction(kind∈{Signature, Mechanism, Work, Check, StructuralReinterpretation})`.  
  **Exact identification (no TGA‑local taxonomy):**  
  — `Signature` **≡** **A.6.0** `U.Signature` (universal, law‑governed declaration).  
  — `Mechanism` **≡** **A.6.1** `U.Mechanism` (law‑governed application over a SubjectKind/BaseType).  
  — `Work` **≡** **A.15** `U.WorkEnactment` (bind‑in‑world; `FinalizeBinding` only here).  
  — `Check` **≡** `OperationalGate(profile)` (universal **gate**; A.* patternisation pending; CC‑TGA catalog applies).  
  — `StructuralReinterpretation` **≡** a species of **A.6.4** `U.EpistemicRetargeting` used as a graph node in E.TGA. **All retargeting semantics** (slot‑level discipline, `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot` behaviour, invariants, Bridges, witnesses) come from **C.2.1** and **A.6.2–A.6.5**; E.TGA does **not** introduce a TGA‑local variant of retargeting.  
  `OperationalGate ≔ U.Transduction(kind=Check)` with DecisionLog aggregation.  
  The only extra discipline E.TGA adds for `StructuralReinterpretation` is **graph‑local**: CtxState and GateCrossing behaviour are governed by **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX** and **CC‑TGA‑11** (projection‑preserving w.r.t. `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`, PathSlice‑local, and “no plane/unit change without a gate”). 

> **MVPK binding (import).** Every vertex with an external surface is published via **MVPK** faces (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `AssuranceLane`, `InteropCard`) under a declared **PublicationScope** (E.17). E.TGA **reuses** MVPK’s publication laws (pins, lawful‑order discipline, “no new numeric claims / no I/O re‑listing”) and only adds graph‑level constraints in S3 and **CC‑TGA‑09/10**; it does **not** define a second, local publication semantics. 

**GateCrossing (normative)**
**Definition.** A **GateCrossing** is the typed transition at a node that changes any of:
  (i) `U.BoundedContext` (**Context**), (ii) **ReferencePlane**, (iii) any member of the **Edition vector** `E⃗` (e.g., `CG‑Spec`, `ComparatorSet`, `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`, `DescriptorMapRef`, `DistanceDefRef`, `CharacteristicSpaceRef`), (iv) **DesignRunTag** (`T^D↔T^R`), or (v) **Kind/describedEntity** (only under `StructuralReinterpretation` subject to **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX**).
**Invariants.** Raw `U.Transfer` preserves `CtxState`; a GateCrossing occurs at exactly one `OperationalGate(profile)` (SquareLaw applies).
**Required pins (minimum).** `BridgeCard + UTS row`; `CL` for scope bridges; `CL^plane` for plane crossings; `CL^k` with `bridgeChannel=Kind` for kind transitions; `PublicationScopeId`; `PathSliceId`; Γ‑pins on compare/launch faces.
**Canonical reference.** `CrossingRef := ⟨GateId, channel, from, to, UTS.RowId, PathSliceId⟩`. Any DecisionLog entry whose rationale depends on a crossing **SHALL** cite `CrossingRef`.
**Term separation.** **Transfer** denotes the sole edge kind `U.Transfer` (graph edges). **Transport** denotes Φ‑governed conversion **policies/registries** (**`TransportRegistry^Φ`** under UNM). Wording “reuse via Transport” refers to registries/policies, not to an additional graph edge.

#### S2 · Flows as valuations (paths + state + guards)
* A **Flow** is a **valuation** `ν` over `U.Transfer` edges and cut‑sets, paired with an **admissible path** `p = v₀ → … → v_k`. The valuation assigns tokens/states under `CtxState` and records publication events under a declared `PublicationScopeId`. **The concrete pins and identifiers (`PathId`, `PathSliceId`, Γ_time on compare/launch faces) are specified in A.22 `FlowSpec` and A.25 `Sentinel & SubFlow`.** This reflects the “graph ≠ flow” norm (flow = valuation), with gates placed exactly on GateCrossings.  
* **Admissible path (definition).** A path `p` is **admissible** iff:  
  (a) node/edge types match the declared `τ_V, τ_E`;  
  (b) any change to `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` (or kind‑retargeting under `StructuralReinterpretation`) appears at **exactly one** `OperationalGate(profile)`;  
  (c) each GateCrossing on `p` has a **SquareLaw witness** (CC‑TGA‑23) and, where applicable, a **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** (CC‑TGA‑06‑EX);  
  (d) no hidden crossings occur across raw transfers;  
  (e) Γ‑pins are present on compare/launch faces;  
  (f) `T^D↔T^R` occurs **only** at `LaunchGate`.

* `U.Transfer` preserves `CtxState` (`⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`) and carries **Assurance‑operations** only (see S3b); any crossing of locus/plane/editions or `T^D↔T^R` is placed at `OperationalGate(profile)`.
* A **PathSlice** is a **slice‑scoped execution window** used for refresh/telemetry; faces pin `PathSliceId`; **re‑emission** happens when any pinned edition changes or `SliceRefresh` is triggered by sentinel rules.

> **Consequences.** The assignment’s “reference flow” is simply one `p` in `TransductionGraph`. Other domains (supply chain, water network, NN functional) instantiate different `p` on the **same architecture**.
> 
**Why "flow = valuation" doesn't kill the "something is flowing" intuition**
There are two complementary perspectives:
* **Lagrangian (intuitive):** "water particles" run through pipes; you "track" tokens.
* **Eulerian (architectural):** you define a **function on edges** ("how much/what passes through each edge under a given regime"), with gate laws. E.TGA deliberately fixes the **Eulerian semantics of flow** at the architectural level: "flow (= valuation) + publication log", while the dynamics of "movement" show up as **re-valuation** over a **PathSlice** (the execution/republishing window) under gate rules and the SquareLaw. This yields comparability, reproducibility, and slice-local refresh.

#### S3 · Publication discipline (faces)

E.TGA **imports E.17** wholesale **and binds MVPK to `PublicationScope` (USM)**.  
**MVPK remains the normative source** for:
* the set of face kinds (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`),
* pin discipline and Publication Characteristics (PC),
* “no new numeric claims / no I/O re‑listing / no Γ‑semantics on faces”.

E.TGA **does not re‑specify** these laws; it only adds **graph‑level obligations** for faces emitted over transduction paths:

1. **Crossings on faces.** When a face participates in a GateCrossing (S1.b/S9), it **SHALL** cite `BridgeId + UTS row + CL` and publish **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane RuleId**; **penalties remain in R‑lane**.
2. **Gate‑requirement on cited editions.** Any face that references editions of `CG‑Spec` / `ComparatorSet` / `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` includes **`BridgeCard + UTS row`**; faces without this are treated as **non‑consumable downstream**.  (delegated tests → A.27/A.34)  
3. **ComparatorSet & set returns (graph‑scope).** Any `ComparatorSet` and `SetSemanticsRef` used along a transduction path **SHALL** carry **edition identifiers**; flows **re‑emit** faces on edition change; faces with comparison **return sets / lawful partial orders** (no hidden scalarization), reusing MVPK’s lawful‑order discipline.
4. **Γ_time on compare/launch faces.** All compare/launch faces on E.TGA paths pin `Γ_time`; implicit *latest* is illegal. The **shape and evaluation** of `Γ_time` live in A.26; E.TGA only mandates presence. **CHR avoids acceptance thresholds** (*NoThresholdsInCHR*); thresholding and launches surface in G‑patterns and `U.Work`.  (delegated tests → A.32/A.33). **Unknowns remain tri‑state (`pass|degrade|abstain`) and fold per GateProfile (A.21/A.26).**  

> **Reminder.** MVPK already bans “signature” on faces, I/O re‑listing, arithmetic on faces, and unpinned numeric content (E.17 §5.4–5.5). E.TGA **does not weaken or override** those rules; it only constrains how they are used along transduction paths.

**Lean publish‑mode (AssuranceLane‑Lite).** Lean affects **faces only** (`PlainView`/`AssuranceLane` minimal), not checks; publication shows `GateProfile`, `GateCheckRef[]`, and `DecisionLogRef`; the underlying GateChecks list remains unchanged.

**Decision stability & idempotency (delegated).** Gate decisions are **idempotent** under a congruence relation over inputs; the **witness and equivalence criteria** are specified in **A.41 DecisionLog**. E.TGA **does not** prescribe storage formats, key shapes, or hashing schemes.

**KindBridge admissibility (publication).**  
Treat a step as a **describedEntity/kind** transition (including `StructuralReinterpretation` under CC‑TGA‑06‑EX) **iff** the **UTS row**:
  — satisfies the **minimal Bridge row** obligations of A.27 (identity, `ReferencePlane`, `CL/CL^plane`, edition‑pins for `CG‑Spec` / `ComparatorSet` / `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`, `ComparatorSetRef`, `BridgeId`, `Φ‑RuleIds`), and  
  — is additionally marked as a **KindBridge** per C.3 (`bridgeChannel=Kind`, `CL^k`, mapping or signature‑translation, order‑preservation claims, loss notes, definedness area, determinism).  
Otherwise this KindBridge explanation does not apply (the step falls back to a gated crossing). When the gate owns the crossing, `CrossingRef` is surfaced and linked from the `DecisionLog`.

#### S4 · Assurance‑operations on `U.Transfer` (counterfactual admissibility)
On `U.Transfer` edges, an operation is interpreted as a **declarative assurance‑operation** **iff** it is one of  
`ConstrainTo(rule)` · `CalibrateTo(map|standard)` · `CiteEvidence(anchor)` · `AttributeTo(agent|role)`; otherwise this explanation does not apply.
Under this interpretation, `CtxState⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is preserved.  
If an effect entails a plane/unit change, the assurance‑operations explanation does not apply and the step is handled as a gated crossing (`OperationalGate(profile)+Bridge+UTS`).  
If Φ assigns penalties, they appear in the R‑lane; otherwise no penalties are surfaced here.

#### S5 · Comparability & aggregation (normalize‑then‑compare; counterfactual form)

The comparison explanation applies under the following admissibility conditions:

* If a path segment intends to compare/aggregate, it is admissible as a comparison **only when** UNM precedes it; UNM is **method‑independent**, publishes **TransportRegistry^Φ** and **CG‑Spec** anchors, and faces cite those editions; otherwise this comparison explanation does not apply.
* If the comparator defines a **lawful partial order**, then returns are **sets/archives** (Pareto/Archive); if a **total order** is declared, it is the one provided by the comparator; otherwise set semantics apply and covert scalarization is out of scope here.
* If a claim is **ordinal‑only**, then only comparisons are surfaced; arithmetic transforms (e.g., means/z‑scores) are out of scope of this explanation and belong to declared comparators or downstream policy.

**Edition‑aware artifacts (e.g., QD archives) MUST pin `DescriptorMapRef.edition` / `DistanceDefRef.edition` (and `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` when applicable); refresh is slice‑local.**  (delegated tests → A.34/A.37)  

#### S6 · Cycle discipline (Selection ↔ Planning)

* The architecture centers the loop between `U.SelectionAndBinding` and `U.WorkPlanning`.
* The loop operates under a local **budget / max_iter** in `Γ_time`; at expiry, the selector emits the **current `CandidateSet`** and **`MethodTuning`** with a **partial‑optimality** flag; further improvement rolls into the **next `PathSlice`**.
* **UNM occurs before the loop**; if measurements are missing/stale, UNM emits a **FreshnessRequest** which is **planned** in `U.WorkPlanning` and **executed** in `U.Work`. Transfers, units, and calibrations are surfaced publication‑wise as `CalibrateTo(map|standard)` and pinned to `TransportRegistry^Φ` (**R‑channel only** for penalties).
* **WorkEnactment is the only binding site** for launch values (`FinalizeBinding / BindLaunchValuesOnly`). 
> **Refresh orchestration.** Telemetry from `U.WorkEnactment` and publications are **slice‑scoped**, editions re‑pinned, faces **re‑emitted**. 

#### S7 · Selector semantics (G.5) & parity harness (G.9)

* **Selectors return sets.** Default **DominanceRegime** is `ParetoOnly`; **Illumination/coverage** are **gauges** (reported), excluded from dominance **unless** policy escalates via CAL.
If `PortfolioMode=Archive`, a **QD archive** may be returned; when generation is in scope, pairs `{environment, method}` are managed under declared **EnvironmentValidityRegion** and **TransferRulesRef**; parity artefacts and `PathSliceId` are pinned on publication. Details of comparator semantics and archive pinning live in **A.28/A.34**.

#### S8 · Guard ownership and handling (USM §1.2)
* **USM.CompareGuard**/**USM.LaunchGuard** **publish `GuardOwnerGateId`**. Guard failures are **events** aggregated by the owner gate (not GateChecks).
* **Ownership rules:** (i) `USM.LaunchGuard.owner = LaunchGateId(U.WorkEnactment)`; (ii) inside a Subflow, `USM.CompareGuard.owner = OperationalGate(InSentinel)`; Join‑nodes cannot own guard pins.

**GateProfile data shape (cross‑reference).** The **entire data shape** (SoD/quorum, declassify, budgets, TOCTOU/freshness windows, editions vector, scopes) is **specified in A.26**. E.TGA **only names** the structure and defers its fields to A.26.

**Bridge‑aware guards (cross‑reference).** USM guards apply bridge‑translation semantics (`translate(Bridge, Scope)`) with CL penalties in R‑lane; the conceptual macro is defined in **A.24 USM.Guards**.

**Error/timeout/unknown (profile‑bound).** GateCheck errors/timeouts fold to **`degrade`** under `Lean|Core` and to **`block`** under `SafetyCritical|RegulatedX`; `unknown` follows the GateCheck’s intensional rule (safety‑default: `degrade`). **The DecisionLog shape and the idempotency witness are defined in A.41; E.TGA does not define storage or key structures.**  

#### S9 · Transport & crossings
* Cross‑Context or cross‑plane edges appear as **GateCrossings** that include a **Bridge** with **CL** policy; **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** are published; penalties route **to R only**; **Scope membership** (USM) is unchanged by crossings. **SquareLaw is checked within a single `DesignRunTag`; a `T^D↔T^R` change is modelled as a pair of coordinated gates with `DesignRunTagFrom/To` and an external enactor (see A.29).** 
* When *describedEntity/kind* changes across a boundary, declare an explicit **KindBridge (`CL^k`)** in addition to plane/context CL; cross‑context reuse of UNM **must** go via `Transport`, with any `CL^plane` penalties routed to **R‑lane** only.

#### S10 · Non‑mechanism boundary

* Publication is a **typed projection**, not execution. Any build/render/upload is **Work on carriers**; **no Γ‑semantics** may leak into faces. 

#### S11 · Coordination thread (optional)
Introduce **CoordinationFlow** as a named thread laid over `U.TransductionFlow__P2W`; crossings with production flow go via **Bridge+UTS**; coordination publishes **LexicalView** labels only and adds **no checks** or mechanisms.

### S12 · Viewpoint families → E.TGA constructs (neutral, holonic)

E.TGA does not mint new viewpoint or view kinds. It **imports** the generic multi‑view machinery of E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`, bundles from E.17.1, and the TEVB engineering bundle from E.17.2. S12 only describes how these existing `U.Viewpoint` / `U.ViewpointBundle` ids are *used* in transduction graphs and in `UTS.ViewpointMap`; intent/concern semantics live in E.17.0–E.17.2.

**Two‑layer use of TEVB and MVPK (ISO 42010 summary, no local re‑definition).**

* **Engineering viewpoints.** For engineering holons, E.TGA assumes a TEVB bundle with `ViewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`. `EngineeringVPId` is one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`, and TEVB is the normative source for their semantics. E.TGA does not refine these viewpoints.  
* **Publication viewpoints.** Publication viewpoints come from MVPK (E.17); `PublicationVPId` is a `MVPK.ViewpointId` that governs faces under a `PublicationScope`.  
* **Architecture description.** Under ISO 42010, an architecture description for a holon is: (i) an E.TGA transduction graph over that holon, plus (ii) MVPK faces emitted for its morphisms, with correspondences per E.17.0 linking each face to the engineering view(s) it implements. Crossings and penalties follow E.TGA’s gating rules (S9; CC‑TGA‑11/23) but do not change viewpoint semantics.  
* **Separation of roles.** `VP.*` from TEVB are **EngineeringVPId** values only; they are not surfaces. `PublicationVPId` values live in MVPK. The mapping between them is entirely via ISO‑style correspondences and the `UTS.ViewpointMap`; E.TGA does not define a second notion of viewpoint.

**Entities‑of‑interest (summary).**

* **EoI‑ENG.** The engineering entity described by TEVB/E.TGA is a holon (`U.System` or `U.Episteme`) per TEVB’s `EoIClassSpec`. E.TGA does not broaden or narrow this set.  
* **EoI‑PUB.** MVPK may treat the *architecture description* itself as an entity‑of‑interest; publication viewpoints for that AD are defined in MVPK, not here. E.TGA only requires that such faces honour MVPK discipline and E.TGA’s crossing rules.

**Naming rules (aligned with E.17.0/E.17.1/E.17.2).**  
* `ViewFamilyId` is the `U.ViewpointBundle.viewFamilyId` (e.g. `VF.TEVB.ENG` for TEVB); its lexical and ontological discipline is governed by E.17.1.  
* `EngineeringVPId : ViewpointId` is always a `U.ViewpointId` drawn from some bundle (for TEVB, one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`). E.TGA never defines new `VP.*` ids.  
* `PublicationVPId : ViewpointId` is a `MVPK.ViewpointId` defined in E.17; TEVB viewpoints are **never** reused as publication viewpoints (per TEVB guard and MVPK).  
* The legacy unqualified column name `ViewpointId` MUST NOT be used. Where it exists, it is interpreted as `PublicationVPId` and is DEPRECATED (sunset when E.23 is published).

**Terminology guards (no local semantics).**
* Within S12, “viewpoint”, “view” and “correspondence” have exactly the meanings given in E.17.0; “publication surface” means an MVPK face (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`) under some `PublicationVPId`.  
* Faces are **carriers for views**: a face is part of a view only when linked via an ISO‑style `CorrespondenceRef` to an engineering `U.View` under some `EngineeringVPId`; S12 does not add extra conditions beyond E.17.0/E.17.2.  
* Labels such as “Functional view”, “Procedural view”, “Role‑Enactor view”, “Module‑Interface view” in this section are lexical aliases for TEVB viewpoints; they MUST NOT be interpreted as extra viewpoint kinds or as surface types.

**Purpose.** Provide a neutral (F.18) mapping from TEVB engineering *viewpoint families* — bundle `VF.TEVB.ENG` with `VP.Functional / VP.Procedural / VP.RoleEnactor / VP.ModuleInterface` — to E.TGA constructs so that the same holon can be described functionally, procedurally, structurally, or as a module‑and‑interface architecture **without changing the underlying graph**. S12 does not introduce new `U.Viewpoint` or `U.View` kinds; it reuses those defined in E.17.0/E.17.2.

**Holon target.** The mapping applies to any holon, with the constraint that only `U.System` enacts `U.Work` (A.3/A.15). Supervisory and structural hierarchies remain distinct (B.2.5).

**Viewpoint family → primary E.TGA constructs (TEVB‑aligned)**  
*All four families referenced below are TEVB engineering viewpoints; the “what …” clauses are interpretive glosses for how they *use* E.TGA constructs. Formal intent/concerns/allowed episteme kinds remain in TEVB (E.17.2).*
1) **Function‑Oriented View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.Functional`, capability‑flow)** — “what transformation is achieved under roles”
    * **Flow substrate:** `U.TransductionFlow__P2W` through nodes `Signature → Mechanism → UNM → SelectionAndBinding ↔ WorkPlanning → Work → EvaluatingAndRefreshing`.
    * **Publication:** MVPK publication surfaces per E.17; comparable claims pin to `CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet` editions; crossings surface via `Bridge+UTS` and `CL/CL^plane` (penalties → **R‑lane** only). 
    * **Checks:** A.20 (CV) inside transformations; A.21 (GateFit) at gates; enforce CSLC/No‑Hidden‑Scalarization per A.28. 
    *  **Holonic note:** `U.Episteme` does not *act*; it is used by systems acting on carriers; `U.Work` appears only for `U.System`. 
2) **Procedure‑Oriented View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.Procedural`, step/time storyboard)** — “what steps occur and when”
    * **Artifacts:** `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2) for intent/schedule; `U.WorkEnactment` for enactment.
    * **Boundary:** entry into `U.WorkEnactment` is via `OperationalGate(profile)` with `USM.LaunchGuard`; `DesignRunTag` separates design time from run time; `DesignRunTagFrom/To` appear only at gates. 
    * **Holonic note:** Applies to any `U.System` scope (single holon or a supervised sub‑holon cluster); supervisory layering is handled by roles rather than structural mereology (B.2.5).
3) **Role‑Enactor / Device‑Structure View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.RoleEnactor`)** — “what carrier/ports/constraints exist; who typically enacts it”
    * **Artifacts:** Module *interfaces* are `Signature` nodes; module realizations are `MechanismRealization` nodes; inter‑module dependencies traverse `U.Transfer`, with gates on crossings. 
    * **Publication:** MVPK faces are **typed projections**, not executable artifacts; faces add **no new numeric claims** (E.17). Constraints and compatibility appear as CV checks (A.20). 
    * **Holonic note:** Structural mereology (part/whole of the carrier) is modeled in Part A; E.TGA binds interface/exposure semantics to morphisms and gates.
    * **Device‑View reading (Transduction↔Transductor).** The same capability‑flow MAY be read as a **device** that performs the transduction (**transductor**) without changing the graph: model with `Signature` + `Mechanism` only; do **not** introduce extra edge kinds. If describedEntity retargets (function↔element), use `StructuralReinterpretation` with a **`KindBridge (CL^k)`** on **UTS** and a **SquareLaw‑Retargeting witness**; preserve `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` and treat it as a non‑crossing (**CC‑TGA‑06‑EX**; witness shape §4.7).  
    * **Role‑label guard.** `TypicalEnactorRoleName` is **pedagogical only** and MUST NOT be used as a GateFit role; GateFit uses `U.Role` (A.21).
4) **Module‑Interface View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.ModuleInterface`, physical/logical architecture)** — “what modules exist and how they contract across interfaces”
    * **Artifacts:** Module *interfaces* are `Signature` nodes; module realizations are `Mechanism` nodes; inter‑module dependencies traverse `U.Transfer`, with gates on crossings. 
    * **describedEntity note:** Functional↔element reinterpretation follows the **Device‑View reading** rule above (Role‑Enactor family) and **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX**; see **§4.7** for the retargeting witness shape and CV witness binding.
    * **Holonic note:** The same module may appear as a holon in multiple views; supervisory loops (B.2.5) remain orthogonal to structural composition.
This is an expandable list of viewpoint families; TGA is intentionally viewpoint‑neutral. Additional engineering bundles beyond TEVB (safety, mission, information, …) are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species via E.17.1/E.17.2; S12 does not define them.

**Alias families for transduction species (LEX‑only).**
*Scope.* Authors MAY declare `AliasesInViewFamilies[]` for `U.Transduction` species so readers can recognise familiar engineering view families. All semantics come from the referenced bundles (typically TEVB) and MVPK; aliases are purely lexical.

*Norms.*
1. Each `U.Transduction` species MAY publish `AliasesInViewFamilies[]` — an open list of records  
   `{ ViewFamilyId, EngineeringVPId?, Alias : TechASCII }`.  
   * If `ViewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`, then `EngineeringVPId` MUST be one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` (TEVB; CC‑TEVB‑1/6).  
   * Other `ViewFamilyId` values MUST denote `U.ViewpointBundle` instances defined elsewhere (e.g. safety/assurance/information bundles), not ad‑hoc local families.
2. Aliases are LEX‑only: **no arithmetic, no new claims, no check participation, no `CtxState` or `DesignRunTag` change**. They do not create MVPK faces.  
3. Aliases MUST NOT be used as `PublicationVPId`; publication viewpoints remain in MVPK.  
4. Twin registers are allowed (Tech/Plain) per E.10; naming follows F.18 local‑first discipline.  
5. Do not name transductions by operands/effects (operation ≠ operand).  
6. `TypicalEnactorRoleName` MAY be added for pedagogy; it SHALL NOT be used as a GateFit role (GateFit uses `U.Role` only).  
7. Morphology: ASCII TitleCase; conjunctions via `And`; for composite actions use `XingAndYing` (or `XAndYing` if grammar requires).  
8. The P2W reference species table (SubstrateFormalization … EvaluatingAndRefreshing with functional/procedural aliases and `TypicalEnactorRoleName`) is **informative** and does not change kind or viewpoint semantics.

**Deliverable — `UTS.ViewpointMap` (normative, TEVB‑aligned).**  
Publish a UTS block named `ViewpointMap` that ties engineering viewpoints (from bundles such as TEVB) to E.TGA constructs and MVPK faces.

*Minimum row schema (per row).*
* `ViewFamilyId` — `U.ViewpointBundle.viewFamilyId` (e.g. `VF.TEVB.ENG` for TEVB, or another bundle id).  
* `EngineeringVPId : ViewpointId` — a viewpoint from that bundle (for TEVB, one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`).  
* `PublicationVPId : ViewpointId?` — MVPK publication viewpoint id that governs faces implementing this engineering view (optional if not publishing).  
* `TargetHolon ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme}` *(extended species may add `{U.Service|U.MethodFamily}`; if `TargetHolon ≠ U.System`, no `U.Work` enactment appears).*  
* `PrimaryTGAConstructs` — nodes/edges/gates actually used for this `(ViewFamilyId, EngineeringVPId, TargetHolon)` (typically one of the four families above).  
* `Crossings{BridgeId, CL/CL^plane?}` — crossings involved; penalties route to R‑lane only.  
* `EditionPins{…}` whenever comparable claims appear (bind to CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet editions; any face citing editions includes `BridgeCard + UTS` row per MVPK/UNM).  
* `SenseCells[]` (≥ 2 per row), each citing Context name + edition (F.17/E.10 discipline; UTS‑wide coverage rules still apply).  
* *(REQUIRED when publishing)* `CorrespondenceRef[]` — ISO 42010 correspondences linking emitted faces to the engineering view(s) they implement; may cross architecture descriptions.  
* *(RECOMMENDED)* `ConcernsCovered[]` — ISO 42010 stakeholder concerns addressed by this row via GateProfiles/check catalogues.

**Conformance (S12‑scoped).**  
(i) `UTS.ViewpointMap` exists.  
(ii) For each holon that claims TEVB alignment, there are ≥ 4 rows whose `{ViewFamilyId, EngineeringVPId}` cover `{VF.TEVB.ENG × {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}}` (per CC‑TEVB‑1/6).  
(iii) Rows that surface editions also include `BridgeCard + UTS` rows per A.27; edition‑bearing faces that lack such rows MUST NOT be used for downstream consumption.  
(iv) Each row has ≥ 2 `SenseCells` and the sheet meets global UTS coverage rules.  
(v) Any `TargetHolon = U.System` that reaches `U.Work` shows `LaunchGate` with `DesignRunTag` consistency.  
(vi) Crossings referenced in `ViewpointMap` follow CC‑TGA‑11; comparability along the mapped paths follows CC‑TGA‑10.  
(vii) Rows MUST NOT use an unqualified `ViewpointId`; they MUST use `EngineeringVPId` and/or `PublicationVPId` explicitly.  
(viii) When faces are published, `CorrespondenceRef[]` MUST be present and resolvable to `U.Viewpoint` ids.  
(ix) Additional bundles (e.g. assurance, information, mission) MAY appear as extra `ViewFamilyId` values but MUST be declared as `U.ViewpointBundle` species; they do not extend `VF.TEVB.ENG`.

### 6 · Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show; concise)

*Show‑A (Supply chain).* Nodes: procurement → inbound QC (UNM) → selection (supplier set; lawful order) ↔ planning (lotting/schedule; budget) → execution (receipts; **WorkEnactment binds**) → refresh (quality telemetry; re‑emit faces). Crossings: vendor Context via **Bridge/CL**; penalties **→ R only**; comparators pinned to CG‑Spec edition. 

*Show‑B (Neural‑net functional).* Nodes: formal substrate (typed tensor ops) → mechanism (combinator algebra) → UNM (dataset normalization; **TransportRegistry^Φ**) → selection (architecture/hyperparam set; Pareto set over accuracy@ratio & FLOPs@ratio) ↔ planning (compute budget horizon) → Work (training runs; Δ anchored) → refresh (parity inserts; slice‑scoped). Faces pin **DescriptorMapRef.edition / DistanceDefRef.edition** when QD metrics are shown; illumination remains a **gauge** by default. 

> *Post‑2015 SoTA echoes (illustrative):* **TAMP/MPC**, **MAP‑Elites / QD (incl. CMA‑ME)**, **refinement‑typed stacks**, **profunctor optics**. **Worked‑examples and Tell–Show–Show vignettes move to A.31/A.34/A.37; E.TGA keeps only the carcass‑level alignment.**

### 7 · Conformance — **Unified checklist (normative)**

| ID | Requirement | Practical test |
|----|-------------|----------------|
| **CC‑TGA‑01 — Single edge kind** | The graph uses exactly one edge kind `U.Transfer`; all plane/Context/edition transitions occur only at nodes via `OperationalGate(profile)`. | Model lint finds no auxiliary edge kinds for unit/plane changes; crossings sit on declared gates. |
| **CC‑TGA‑02 — Nodes are morphisms** | Nodes are intensional `U.Transduction(kind∈{Signature,Mechanism,Work,Check,StructuralReinterpretation})`. This enumeration is a **minimal roles baseline**. **Domain‑specific species are open‑world** and non‑exhaustive; they bind to one of these kinds. Adding a **new kind** requires an explicit E.TGA update. `StructuralReinterpretation` nodes are **projection‑preserving** (no mutation of `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`) and carry CV/GF obligations per A.20/A.21/A.45. **Mapping to A.\*** (normative): the enumeration is **not** a TGA‑local taxonomy; each `kind` is identified 1‑to‑1 with its A.\* anchor: `Signature→A.6.0`, `Mechanism→A.6.1`, `Work→A.15`, `Check→OperationalGate` (until a dedicated A.\* pattern is published). **Disambiguation:** `Signature (kind)` ≠ `KindSignature` (C.3.2) and ≠ `A.6 Architheory Signature` view. | Type registry shows at least the listed kinds; additional species map to one of them; checks realized as `OperationalGate` (see CC‑TGA‑06‑EX/11). **Lint:** registry/table exposes `{species → {kind, KindDefinition}}`; missing or mismatched `KindDefinition` fails. |
| **CC‑TGA‑03 — Identity, composition, functorial faces** | Identities exist; path composition associative; publication is functorial: `Emit_s(t₂∘t₁)=Emit_s(t₂)∘Emit_s(t₁)`. | Pick two‑step path; MVPK faces commute (Square witness). |
| **CC‑TGA‑04 — Graph spec** | Spec declares `τ_V, τ_E`, `Γ_time`, Transport/Bridge registries. | Spec file shows typed registries and Γ policy. |
| **CC‑TGA‑05 — CtxState pins** | `CtxState=⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is pinned on ports/tokens; raw `U.Transfer` does **not** change it. | Along a raw transfer, ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ is preserved. |
| **CC‑TGA‑06 — Operational gates only** | Any change in ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ or entry into `U.WorkEnactment` is mediated by `OperationalGate(profile)` with aggregated `DecisionLog`. | Diff CtxState across edges; if changed, exactly one gate exists with DecisionLog. |
| **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX (strictly limited) — Projection retargeting without gate** | A node of kind **`StructuralReinterpretation`** MAY retarget the **published projection** without invoking `OperationalGate` **only if all hold**: **(a)** `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is preserved; **(b)** any **describedEntity** change has a **KindBridge** (`CL^k`) entry on MVPK/**UTS**; **(c)** a **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** is present (on UTS); **(d)** the operation is **PathSlice‑local** (`PathSliceId` pinned); **(e)** **no plane/unit change** occurs (plane/unit changes remain gated); **(f)** **CV.ReinterpretationEquivalence** (A.20) is `pass`; **(g)** **NoHiddenScalarization** — if the step concerns a comparable return shape, set/partial‑order semantics are preserved and comparators remain ref‑only (cf. A.28). | UTS row includes `bridgeChannel=Kind` and `CL^k`; SquareLaw‑retargeting witness present; PathSliceId pinned; CV status recorded; no scalarization detected. |
| **CC‑TGA‑07 — CV⇒GF activation predicate** | Until **aggregated `ConstraintValidity` = `pass`**, all **GateFit** checks return `abstain`. | Simulate CV failure ⇒ GateFit `abstain`. |
| **CC‑TGA‑08 — LaunchGate discipline (incl. pre‑run barrier)** | Each `U.WorkEnactment` has exactly one `LaunchGate` owning `USM.LaunchGuard`; **mandatory** checks: `FreshnessUpToDate`, `DesignRunTagConsistency`. If preceding step’s CV ≠ `pass`, LaunchGate decision is `block` (cause logged). | Owner resolution `GuardOwnerGateId = LaunchGateId(U.WorkEnactment)`; CV≠pass ⇒ `block` with log. |
| **CC‑TGA‑09 — MVPK publication discipline** | Every surfaced node uses MVPK; faces carry `PublicationScopeId`, presence‑pins, **edition ids**, Γ pins; **no I/O duplication** or arithmetic; faces add no new numeric claims. | Cards show `PublicationScopeId`; pins present; no “signature”/math on faces. |
| **CC‑TGA‑10 — Normalize→Compare (CSLC)** | Any comparison cites **UNM/CG‑Spec** editions and **ComparatorSetRef**; ordinal claims are compare‑only; partial orders return sets; edition‑aware artifacts (QD/archives) pin `{DescriptorMapRef, DistanceDefRef, CharacteristicSpaceRef?}.edition`; **any face citing editions includes `BridgeCard + UTS row`**. **NoHiddenScalarization — detection criteria:** (1) return shape is **set/poset**, not scalar; (2) `ComparatorSetRef` is present and edition‑pinned; (3) MVPK faces add **no new numeric claims**; (4) any summarisation is **order‑preserving & set‑valued**; otherwise conformance fails. | Faces show comparator pins; archive pins present; linter rejects edition cites without UTS; scalarisation checks pass.
| **CC‑TGA‑11 — Crossings gated** | Cross‑Context/plane crossings publish **BridgeId + UTS + CL/CL^plane** and are mediated by `OperationalGate(profile)`; **Φ/Φ_plane penalties → R‑lane only**; describedEntity change publishes **KindBridge (CL^k)**. **Exception (StructuralReinterpretation):** a **projection‑only** describedEntity retargeting is surfaced **without** a gate **iff** **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX** holds; then the UTS row includes `bridgeChannel=Kind`, `CL^k`, and a **retargeting witness**; any plane/unit change falls back to a gated crossing; `PathSliceId` is pinned; UNM reuse cross‑context continues via `Transport`. | Crossing surfaces show Bridge/UTS/CL pins; penalties routing audited. |
| **CC‑TGA‑12 — Set‑returning selection** | `U.SelectionAndBinding` returns sets/archives under declared comparators (`ParetoOnly` by default) — no covert scalarization. | Selector output is a set/archive; policy id present if escalated. |
| **CC‑TGA‑13 — Budgeted Selection↔Planning loop** | The loop declares **budget / max_iter**; on expiry selector publishes partial‑optimal set + `MethodTuning`; next **PathSlice** scheduled. | Logs show budget stop and slice rollover. |
| **CC‑TGA‑14 — UNM before loop & Freshness lifecycle** | UNM runs before selection; stale/missing inputs produce **FreshnessTicket/FreshnessRequest** planned in `WorkPlanning` and executed in `WorkEnactment`; calibrations appear as `CalibrateTo(map|standard)` with Φ pins. | Ticket state machine Issued→Planned→Executed→Closed; calibrations pinned. |
| **CC‑TGA‑15 — FinalizeBinding only in WorkEnactment** | Only `U.WorkEnactment` performs `FinalizeBinding` and binds launch values. | Any earlier attempt blocks at LaunchGate; binding witness present in Work. |
| **CC‑TGA‑16 — Guard ownership & semantics** | `USM.CompareGuard`/`USM.LaunchGuard` publish owner gate; guards are **events**, not GateChecks; failures are aggregated by owner’s gate per profile. | Guard pins show owner; GuardFail routed to owner’s DecisionLog. |
| **CC‑TGA‑17 — Assurance ops on Transfer** | On `U.Transfer` only `ConstrainTo/CalibrateTo/CiteEvidence/AttributeTo`; none mutate `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`. | Edge audit shows ops; CtxState unchanged across the edge. |
| **CC‑TGA‑17a — Assurance ops contracts (normative)** | **ConstrainTo(region|policy)**: tightens declared region/policy; **pre**: region⊆current; **post**: `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` unchanged; **idem.** and **monotone** under composition. **CalibrateTo(map|standard)**: attaches **editioned** calibration map/standard with Φ‑policy id; lawful per CG‑Spec; **post**: `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` unchanged; **idem.** on same edition; penalties **→ R only**. **CiteEvidence(anchor)**: binds carriers via **SCR/RSCR**; adds no numeric claims; **idem.**; missing carriers ⇒ **abstain**. **AttributeTo(role|source)**: provenance only; decision algebra unaffected; **idem.** Hidden GateChecks, plane/unit changes, or edition writes on edges are **forbidden**. | Contracts visible on edge audit; violations fail lint. |
| **CC‑TGA‑18 — Flow = valuation & slice‑local refresh** | A flow declares valuation `ν` over `U.Transfer` plus `PublicationScopeId` and `PathSliceId`; **sentinel‑bounded** refresh; re‑emit on edition change or sentinel rule. | FlowSpec shows ν; sentinel bump triggers slice‑local recompute. |
| **CC‑TGA‑19 — Γ_time on compare/launch** | All compare/launch faces pin `Γ_time`; no implicit *latest*. | Face audit shows Γ pins; LaunchGate blocks on stale. |
| **CC‑TGA‑19a — Γ_time pin shape (normative)** | The `Γ_time` pin is one of: `snapshot(t)`, `interval[t1,t2]` (closed), or `policy(Γ_timeRuleId)` that resolves to either; CV computations record the **resolved time basis** in `DecisionLog` and do not widen Γ at publication time. | DecisionLog shows basis; linter rejects missing/implicit Γ. |
| **CC‑TGA‑20 — Lean publish‑mode ≠ weaken** | `AssuranceLane‑Lite` affects faces only; required GateChecks for the active profile remain intact. | Gate in Lean/Core shows minimal pins; GateChecks list unchanged. |
| **CC‑TGA‑21 — Decision stability & idempotency witness** | Gate decisions are stable under the equivalence relation defined in **A.41**; a **witness of equivalence** is present on the DecisionLog surface; any change that breaks equivalence requires re‑aggregation. **Minimum lexeme (CV‑relevant surfaces):** `EquivalenceWitness := { keys, E⃗, Γ_time(basis), PathSliceId?, ReturnShapeClass, ComparatorSetRef?, profile }`. | Modify any input outside the declared equivalence ⇒ re‑aggregation; DecisionLog records the witness (A.41); lexeme present.
| **CC‑TGA‑21a — Decision join (publication algebra)** | Aggregation over GateChecks is the **idempotent, commutative, associative join** on the lattice `abstain ≤ pass ≤ degrade ≤ block` with **neutral = `abstain`** and **absorbing = `block`**. The algebra is conceptual; publications surface only (i) the aggregated **GateDecision** and (ii) its **GateDecisionRationale** recorded in the **DecisionLog**. A **GateDecisionExplanation** is an optional human‑readable narrative derived from the GateDecisionRationale; it is **not** a decision and MUST NOT be used as one. If aggregated `ConstraintValidity ≠ pass` or the active profile suppresses narratives, any GateFit‑oriented GateDecisionExplanation **does not apply**. | Review a gate with multiple GateChecks: the aggregated decision matches the lattice join; no per‑check arithmetic is introduced on faces. |
| **CC‑TGA‑22 — Errors/unknowns fold by profile** | Errors/timeouts fold to `degrade` under `Lean|Core` and to `block` under `SafetyCritical|RegulatedX`; `unknown` folds per GateCheck policy (safety‑default: `degrade`). | DecisionLog shows folds; profile switch changes fold behavior accordingly. |
| **CC‑TGA‑23 — SquareLaw on crossings** | For every GateCrossing, `gate_out ∘ transfer = transfer' ∘ gate_in`; LaunchGate case is mandatory. | MVPK shows commuting square; inconsistency yields `block|degrade` per profile. |
| **CC‑TGA‑24 — UNM single‑writer** | `CG‑Spec`, `ComparatorSet`, `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` editions are authored only by `UNM.Authoring` (others ref‑only). | Authorship cards: UNM is sole writer; others have refs only. |
| **CC‑TGA‑25 — Evidence lanes & DecisionLogs** | AssuranceLane surfaces GateProfile, GateCheckRef list, edition pins, aggregated decision, `DecisionLogRef`; **evidence pins follow a two‑layer scheme**: **carriers** are pinned via **`SCR/RSCR`**, and **value annotations** are surfaced under **`VALATA (VA/LA/TA)`**. | Gate surfaces include these pins; logs retrievable. |

> **Coupling note.** `CC‑TGA‑07 (CV⇒GF)` and `CC‑TGA‑21a (Decision join)` together ensure that any GateFit‑scoped GateCheckRef **returns `abstain`** until the aggregated CV status equals `pass`; CV/GF separation remains intact. 
> **Authoring note (scope of E.TGA vs A.*):** Detailed, mechanism‑level checks and most publication content are specified in the **A.* patterns** (A.20…A.42). E.TGA fixes only carcass‑level obligations above.

**Glossary (additions)**  
* *Open‑world species* — non‑exhaustive domain‑level specializations of `U.Transduction` that map to the minimal kind set.  
* *Signature (TGA kind)* — `U.Transduction(kind=Signature)`; **identical to** **A.6.0** `U.Signature` (universal block). **Not** a `C.3.2 KindSignature`.  
* *Architheory Signature (A.6)* — family‑specific **view** and discipline that **specialises** A.6.0 for architheories; the universal A.6.0 block remains the source of truth.  
* *KindSignature (C.3.2)* — intensional definition of a `U.Kind` (intent/extent, F); **unrelated** to TGA kinds; never a `genus`.  
* *Species (domain‑level)* — typed specialisations `speciesOf(kind=…)` that **MUST** declare `KindDefinition=A.*` id (e.g., `kind=Mechanism; KindDefinition=A.6.1`).  
* *KindBridge (`CL^k`)* — a compatibility surface on UTS for describedEntity/kind transitions; required by CC‑TGA‑06‑EX and crossings (CC‑TGA‑11).
* *Eulerian interpretation* — operational stance where a flow is treated as a valuation over `U.Transfer` and edges perform assurance‑only operations (no token‑passing semantics).
* **GateCheckRef shape (publication lexeme, normative here).** Where GateChecks are surfaced, a **GateCheckRef** is a record
  `GateCheckRef := { aspect, kind, edition, scope }` with:
  `aspect ∈ {ConstraintValidity, GateFit}`, `kind ∈ GateCheckKind`, `edition ∈ Editions`, and `scope ∈ {lane | locus | subflow | profile}`. 
* **GateDecision / GateDecisionRationale / GateDecisionExplanation (terminology).**
  — **GateDecision** — the aggregated lattice value produced by `OperationalGate(profile)` for a specific `{GateProfile, GateCheckRef[]}`.
  — **GateDecisionRationale** — the minimal structured support **for that GateDecision**: per‑check outcomes, profile‑bound folds, and surfaced evidence/witness references on the DecisionLog; it records **why the GateDecision is admissible** under the active profile.
  — **GateDecisionExplanation** — an optional human‑readable narrative derived from the GateDecisionRationale; it **does not carry decision status**. While aggregated `ConstraintValidity ≠ pass`, GateFit‑scoped checks return `abstain`; any GateFit‑oriented GateDecisionExplanation **does not apply**.
> **Clarity note.** **GateDecision ≠ GateDecisionExplanation**; narratives are optional and derivative of GateDecisionRationale.

* **GateFit (aspect, not an entity).** GateFit names the **aspect** of checks that evaluate **profile‑fit**; there is no separate GateFit entity. “Gate decision under GateFit” means “the gate’s decision computed from GateChecks with `aspect=GateFit`”.

  This shape is publication‑level only; it introduces no new execution steps and no arithmetic on faces.  (Couples to A.20/A.21 without duplicating their check catalogs.)
* *VALATA (VA/LA/TA)* — value‑annotation scheme used on **AssuranceLane**; **carriers** are referenced via **SCR/RSCR**; detailed obligations live in A.10/A.29. Included here so evidence pins are self‑describing in E‑level texts.
* *Transfer vs Transport* — **Transfer** = the sole graph edge kind `U.Transfer`. **Transport** = Φ‑policy/registry‑defined conversions (`TransportRegistry^Φ`) referenced by UNM; “reuse via Transport” refers to the latter.
* *GateCrossing* — a typed node transition that changes a CtxState slot or the kind‑channel; see **S1.b** for the normative list and required pins.
* *Admissible path* — a typed path obeying the GateCrossing discipline (no hidden crossings; witnesses present), Γ‑pinned on compare/launch, and `T^D↔T^R` only at `LaunchGate`; see **S2**.

### Gating Profiles (applied to E.TGA)

> Gating is expressed as **publication‑gating** per E.17 profiles. The graph model aligns with the **CC items** listed for the chosen profile; higher profiles include all lower‑profile items.

| Profile                          | Required CC‑items                                         | Additional notes                                                                               |                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lean**                         | 01–06, 08–09, 11–12, 15, 19–21, 25                                                                                                           | Minimal MVPK presence; LaunchGate keeps `FreshnessUpToDate` & `DesignRunTagConsistency`. |
| **Core**                         | **Lean** + 07, 10, 13–14, 16–18, 22–23, 24                                                                                                  | Adds CV⇒GF order, CSLC pins, budgeted loop, guards, valuation/sentinel refresh, error folds, SquareLaw, UNM single‑writer. |
| **Safety‑Critical / RegulatedX** | **Core** + profile‑specific GateChecks (safety envelope, regulator id/editions) with stricter folds per **CC‑TGA‑22**; SquareLaw audits tightened | — |

**Recommended defaults (non‑normative, tie‑in to A.26).** Profiles inherit along a `PathSlice`; local overrides may only **add** GateChecks; weakening requires a new `PathSlice` via sentinel (cf. A.26/A.25).
### TGA LEX discipline (registration)
Register Tech tokens (ASCII) used by this architecture with twin‑labels: `U.TransductionGraph`, `U.TransductionFlow`, `StructuralReinterpretation`, `OperationalGate`, `GateProfile`, `GateCheckRef`, **`GateCheckKind`**, `DecisionLog`, `USM.CompareGuard`, `USM.LaunchGuard`, `KindBridge`, `SubflowRef`, `FlowEmbed`, `SentinelId`, `PathSliceId`, `SliceRefresh`, `FinalizeBinding`, `VALATA`. Add an ASCII alias **`CLKind`** ↔ Plain `CL^k` (cf. `CLPlane` ↔ `CL^plane`). Reference MVPK E.17 naming for faces.  
**CtxState Extension Registry.** Register any extra CtxState slot beyond ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ with: slot id, informal intent, partial‑order law (with neutral/absorbing), SquareLaw compatibility note, and the owning Gate profile(s) that may change it. Absence of registration ⇒ **non‑conformant**.

### Consequences

**Benefits.**

1. **Universality with discipline:** one edge kind and explicit gates eliminate “second process ladders” and make cross‑domain flows (ML, supply‑chain, TAMP/MPC, scientific workflows) uniformly analyzable and auditable.
2. **Comparability & replayability:** CSLC and edition‑pinned comparators prevent covert scalarization and enable lawful set returns and reproducible decisions.
3. **Locality of change:** sentinel subflows restrict refresh to affected `PathSlice`s; large graphs remain stable under frequent edition bumps.
4. **Clean design/run fold:** LaunchGate and `DesignRunTagConsistency` stop premature binding; acceptance and telemetry live where they occur (`U.Work`).
5. **Assurance visibility:** MVPK makes GateProfile/DecisionLog surfaces locally checkable and cacheable for the same `{PathSlice, GateChecks, Editions}`.

**Trade‑offs.**
a) **Higher upfront modeling cost:** explicit Bridge/UTS pins and GateProfiles demand care; mitigated by Lean profile and templates.
b) **Longer edge surfaces:** MVPK faces are verbose by design; Lean surfaces can be used for low‑risk segments.
c) **Tooling alignment:** some incumbent DAG‑only orchestrators conflict with budgeted cycles and set‑return semantics; adapters must project E.TGA semantics to their interop layer (never the other way round).

### Rationale

E.TGA enforces **strict separation of concerns** (carcass‑level only); **specialized semantics live in A.* patterns**:

* **What the graph is:** typed intensional morphisms and a single transport edge `U.Transfer`.
* **Where/when it may cross contexts:** **only** at `OperationalGate(profile)`, with Bridge+UTS, CL/CL^plane, and Φ routed to R‑lane.
* **How comparability works:** UNM authors units/planes/transports (single writer) and selectors operate **only** on normalized, edition‑pinned comparators, returning sets/archives—not totals. **Edition‑aware pins and archive semantics are tested in A.28/A.34/A.37 (not repeated here).**
* **How change propagates:** sentinel‑bounded `PathSlice` refresh; editions are monotone; LaunchGate is the only binder of launch‑values.

This arrangement guarantees **functorial publication** (commuting squares on crossings) and **orthogonality** of inner technical validity (ConstraintValidity) to context fit (GateFit), which in turn makes gate aggregation **order‑independent** and cements the CV⇒GF activation predicate.

## SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015, multi‑Tradition)

> Each item states **Adopt / Adapt / Reject**, and why. Vendor/tool tokens are kept as *informative*, not normative.

1. **Applied category theory (compositional open systems).**
   **Adopt.** Monoidal composition and wiring justify “nodes as morphisms, edges as carriers” and functorial publication of faces; they also provide algebraic laws for joining subflows. (Fong & Spivak, *Seven Sketches in Compositionality*, 2019).

2. **Operads / wiring diagrams / hypergraph categories.**
   **Adopt/Adapt.** Typed ports and decorated cospans model interfaces and “Bridge” junctions; we adapt the operadic composition to require CL/Φ pins on every crossing (publication‑level requirement not present in the math). (Spivak, *Operads of Wiring Diagrams*, 2021; Baez & Fong, *A Compositional Framework for Passive Linear Circuits*, 2015).

3. **Open‑graph/string‑diagram rewriting.**
   **Adapt.** Rewriting systems capture subflow refactors, but E.TGA binds rewrites to edition bumps and sentinel scopes rather than global rewrites, to preserve auditability and replay. (Bonchi et al., *Graphical Linear Algebra*, 2019; Kissinger—survey lineage).

4. **Publication discipline & artefact portability.**  
**Adopt.** Edition‑pinning and immutable registries echo contemporary reproducibility practice; E⃗ stays explicit and compositional at the publication layer.

5. **Reproducibility & content addressability.**  
   **Adopt.** Edition‑pinning and immutable registries echo modern content‑addressable reproducibility (conceptual); E⃗ stays explicit and compositional at the publication layer.

6. **TAMP/MPC (integrated planning and control).**
   **Adopt/Adapt.** The budgeted Selection↔Planning loop follows contemporary TAMP practice; MPC‑style freshness/constraint checks motivate **FreshnessUpToDate** as a hard LaunchGate module and “bind‑in‑Work‑only”. (Garrett, Lozano‑Pérez, Kaelbling, *Integrated Task and Motion Planning*, 2021; Rawlings et al., MPC updates).

7. **Quality‑Diversity (QD) search.**
   **Adopt.** QD (e.g., CMA‑ME, 2020) justifies **set‑return** and archive semantics in `U.SelectionAndBinding`; E.TGA bans covert scalarization that would collapse archives to single “bests”.

8. **Profunctor optics (modular projections).**
   **Adopt/Adapt.** Optics motivate view/projection discipline behind MVPK faces; we adapt by forbidding MVPK faces from introducing new claims (they are pure projections, not transformations). (Pickering, Gibbons, Wu, **Profunctor Optics**, 2019).

*Cross‑tradition note.* Items 1–3 (category‑theoretic), 4–5 (publication/reproducibility concepts), 6 (controls/robotics), 7 (evolutionary search), and 8 (PL/semantics) jointly anchor E.TGA across multiple traditions, per E.8.

## Bias‑Annotation (per E.8 SG‑bias slot)

* **Acyclic‑bias risk.** Tooling accustomed to DAGs may discourage legal feedback loops; E.TGA explicitly permits loops with budget/sentinel controls (CC‑TGA‑13,‑18).
* **Scalarization‑bias risk.** Cultural defaults to single‑score rankings can suppress Pareto/QD sets; E.TGA requires lawful orders and return‑sets (CC‑TGA‑10,‑12).
* **Interop‑dominance risk.** File/format ecosystems (CWL/RO‑Crate/lineage) can leak into semantics; E.TGA places them in **InteropCard** and keeps intensional semantics in nodes/gates.
* **Over‑formalization risk.** Category‑theoretic formalisms can obscure operational guard‑rails; E.TGA grounds crossings in Bridge/UTS/CL/Φ pins and SquareLaw audits (CC‑TGA‑11,‑17).
* **Retrospective rewrite risk.** Global rewrites break replay; E.TGA confines them to edition bumps and slice‑local refresh (CC‑TGA‑16).

**Mitigations.** Profile‑gated publication, audit of `DecisionLog`, mandatory edition pins, Lean‑to‑Core upgrade paths, and conformance tests tied to PathSlice replay.

### Relations (explicit pattern‑to‑pattern edges)

> Directed edges (→) are typed as **builds_on / constrains / hosts / specializes / publishes_on / requires / provides_checks_for**.

**Foundations**
* **E.TGA →builds_on→ E.17 MVPK (for Morphisms).** Faces, pins, lanes, functorial publication, Lean/Core/Regulated profiles.
* **E.TGA →builds_on→ A.6.0 U.Signature / A.6.1 U.Mechanism.** Node kinds and intensional content boundaries.
* **E.TGA →builds_on→ A.7 Strict Distinction (I/D/S vs Surface).** No new claims on faces; faces project morphisms.

**Flow semantics & checks**
* **E.TGA →hosts→ A.20 U.Flow (ConstraintValidity scope).** CV checks live inside transformations; no declaration/translation of planes/units in CV; **error/timeout/unknown folds** follow **CC‑TGA‑22** as the **minimum default** (profiles may be stricter).
  **Terminology discipline (A.20 boundary).** In CV scope, publications use **status/witness** language; **GateDecisionRationale/GateDecisionExplanation** are reserved for gating and do not apply to CV.
* **E.TGA →hosts→ A.21 GateProfilization (GateFit scope).** **GateFit-scoped GateChecks** are aggregated by `OperationalGate(profile)` with CV⇒GF activation; the **enumeration and publication shape** of GateChecks live in **A.21**. **Equivalently:** a GateFit decision different from `abstain` appears only when aggregated `ConstraintValidity = pass`; otherwise the **GateDecisionExplanation (GateFit‑oriented)** does not apply.
* **E.TGA →requires→ USM.CompareGuard / USM.LaunchGuard.** Guards publish scope & ownership; guard failures route to owner gate.
* **E.TGA →constrains→ F.* (Bridge+UTS, CL/CL^plane, Φ→R).** A transition is treated as a **Crossing** iff `Bridge+UTS` and the appropriate `CL/CL^plane` are surfaced; otherwise this crossing explanation does not apply. Where Φ defines penalties, they appear in the R‑lane only.
* **Operational interpretation (default): Eulerian.** A flow is a **valuation** over `U.Transfer`; edges carry **assurance‑only operations** (see CC‑TGA‑17); no token‑passing semantics are assumed.

**UNM & comparability**
* **E.TGA →constrains→ UNM.Authoring / UNM.Usage.** Single‑writer for `CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet/UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`; normalize‑then‑compare is mandatory.
* **E.TGA →constrains→ G.5 SelectionAndBinding.** Set‑returning, comparator‑pinned decisions, no hidden scalarization; `MethodTuning` without launch binding.
* **E.TGA →constrains→ G.11 EvaluatingAndRefreshing.** EditionBumpProposal, two‑phase commit in UNM.Authoring, path‑local refresh.

**Work boundary**
* **E.TGA →requires→ A.15 U.WorkEnactment (Bind‑in‑Work‑only).** Single point of `FinalizeBinding`; `FreshnessUpToDate` hard at LaunchGate; acceptance/telemetry published here.

**Structure & reuse**
* **E.TGA →specializes→ U.TransductionFlow (and its family).** The graph architecture is the common substrate on which flow patterns (e.g., P2W, EvaluatingAndRefreshing) are defined; E.TGA ensures their crossings, guards, and MVPK faces are coherent.
* **E.TGA →publishes_on→ E.17 MVPK views** (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`) for every edge/node where publication occurs; Lean mode allowed only as per profile.

### Conformance evidence (how to show you comply)

1. **Model lint:** run static checks for CC‑TGA‑01…25 (edge kind, gates on crossings, CV⇒GF, guard ownership, single‑writer UNM, SquareLaw).
2. **Publication audit:** sample a commuting square and a sentinel‑bounded subflow; verify pins and DecisionLog behavior on *block/degrade*.
3. **Replay test:** freeze editions; re‑run selection on a PathSlice; observe identical return‑sets; apply a bump; see only affected `PathSlice`s refresh.
4. **StructuralReinterpretation probe:** construct a minimal reinterpretation step; confirm `CL^k` with `bridgeChannel=Kind` on UTS, a SquareLaw‑retargeting witness on UTS, `PathSliceId` pinned, **CV.ReinterpretationEquivalence=pass**, and absence of hidden scalarization.
