# UTS (Unified Term Sheet) for a Domain

**Goal:** Build a disciplined vocabulary for a niche field using FPF Part F.

## Prompt

> You have the FPF specification loaded.
> Produce a Unified Term Sheet (UTS) block for the core terms of <your domain>: at least 10 rows.
> Use F.17 and F.18: distinguish Tech vs Plain names, show SenseCells for 2–3 key bounded contexts, and flag risky aliases.

## Follow-up for Quantitative Structure

- "For the same domain, propose a Q-bundle that captures the quality of <your object/process> and produce a UTS block for its characteristics (CHR) and indicators."
