# Characterisation & Indicators for a New Project

**Goal:** Get a step-by-step chain from "vague idea" to measurable characteristics, indicators, scoring and decision criteria.

## Prompt

> You have the FPF specification loaded as a file.
> We are starting work on <brief description of project>, design has not yet begun.
> Propose a step-by-step chain for characterising the objects of our project, normalising measurements, defining indicators, scoring alternatives, and choosing design decisions.
> Include steps that I may have forgotten.
> Write in the language of engineer-managers, not in FPF jargon.

## Typical Follow-ups

- "Now take object <X> from this chain and work it through in detail: list 10–15 characteristics, their scales, indicators, and a rough dashboard format for decision-makers."
- "Show how this chain maps to P2W in E.TGA for this project."
