# SoTA Harvesting & Discipline Packs

**Goal:** Use Part G to organise a frontier discipline around first principles.

## Prompt

> We are in search for SoTA of <discipline>.
> Using G.2 and G.4, extract: (a) TraditionCards for competing schools of thought; (b) OperatorCards for their main operators / update rules; (c) a first draft of a SoTA Pack and selector-ready portfolio. This is expected to be a long text, therefore start with only TraditionCards.
